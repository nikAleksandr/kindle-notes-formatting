They knew that all these scandals were somehow a part of the enormous changes that were happening to American society.  But they also knew that the new technologies and giant industries were bringing amazing benefits and transforming their world and the way they related to each other. Nobody seemed to be able to understand the true dimensions of what was happening.

Statistician Andrew Gelman refers to this as “the garden of forking paths”: If you don’t specify your route before you start, any place you end up can be made to seem like a meaningful destination.

Go placidly amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story. Avoid loud and aggressive persons; they are vexatious to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter, for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself. Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism. Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass. Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be.

Te Cuban health system coordinates three points of health care delivery: a family doctor in each neighborhood (one for every 150 people), a 24-hour “polyclinic” for urgent care and a hospital, including separate maternity hospitals for births and abortions. When a Cuban hasn’t been to the doctor for more than six months, his or her family doctor—who knows every person individually— makes a house call regardless of whether the person has a known health problem.

Some days it feels like it’s all going kablooey – that the Cuba we’ve known is reserved now for dewy-eyed nostalgics fngering grainy photos of the 10 million ton harvest. And this is heart breaking to people who have survived so much drama and tragedy: the rending of families in the 60s and 70s, (plus the Bay of Pigs and Missile Crisis), followed by the Mariel boat lift and collapse of the Eastern Bloc in the 80s which led to the torturous Special Period of the 90s.

musical multimedia (IMM), for which Nicholas Cook has provided a theoretical framework. Cook distinguishes types of multimedia events according to the character of the relationships among the media. These can be of three types: conformance, complementation, and contest. Conformance describes situations in which other media are consistent with the music (and vice versa); complementation, those cases in which music and other media complete one another to form a whole expression; and contest, those situations in which music and other media are in conflict or competition with one another.

Horkheimer rightly note that Odysseus’s desire for pleasure is sublimated into aesthetic experience; he can hear the song, but he can do nothing about it. They also correctly point to the historical moment in which aesthetic experience becomes class bound. The oarsmen merely row; their ears are closed, and they do not get to share Odysseus’s aesthetic experience, yet they provide the means for it to take place.

Use appears to offer a glimpse into the internal workings and strategies engaged in by users in their management of themselves, others, and urban space by engaging in a series of self-regulatory practices through which they habitually manage their moods, volitions, and desires.

The experiences of the city described by Kracauer and those of the iPod user remain deeply mediated and commoditized. Both sets of descriptions are filmic in character. Kracauer’s urban stroller lives in the polyrhythmic, audiovisual world of the street, which presents itself to him as a spectacle in which the street becomes a commodified dream. In contrast, iPod users construct a monorhythmic aesthetic narrative to the street deciphered from the sounds of the culture industry emanating from the iPod. Theirs is a hyper-post-Fordist street of potentially multiple audiovisual scenarios—with each iPod user constructing her own singular, mediated dream-world simultaneously. Whereas Kracauer’s subject is diminished, made smaller by the enormity of the street and its illuminated signs, iPod users such as Sophie, a marketing manager from London, describe their iPod experiences as “making the world look smaller—I am much bigger and powerful listening to music. The world is generally a better place, or at the very least it is sympathetic to my mood…. [Y]ou become part of the music and can take on a different persona.”

The iPod users’ overriding aim is to create a privatized sound-world that is in harmony with their mood, orientation, and surroundings, enabling them to re-create their urban experience through a process that might be described as solipsistic aestheticization. Rather than reaching out to understand or see the “otherness” of the city as “otherness,” as represented by the traditional practices of the flaneur, for example, iPod users aim to habitually create an aesthetically pleasing urban world for themselves in their own image. Theirs is a strategy of bringing the world in line with their cognitive predispositions, as an act of mimicry. This aesthetic appropriation of urban space is a prominent cognitive strategy in their attempt to create seamless webs of mediated and privatized experience in their everyday movement through the city, enhancing virtually any chosen experience in any geographical location at will.

This privatizing of urban experience through technologies like the Apple iPod appears rather to represent a potentially dystopian moment in urban theory, one in which the subject responds to the urban with strategies of retreat, neutralization, or aestheticization. These dystopian responses are located theoretically in the perceived sensory oppressiveness of the urban crowd, in the neutralizing architectural spaces of the city, and in the values and disposition of the urban subject

An essential component of this transcendence for the urban citizen is to replace the multirhythmic and hence unmanageable nature of urban life with her own manageable audiovisual monorhythms. In enacting these practices, iPod use embodies the dialectic of utopian and dystopian impulses—aestheticization is an active mode of appropriating the urban, transforming that which exists by making it the user’s own. The desire to engage in these processes derives both from the habitual predispositions of users located in wider media use—for are not television and film viewers equally in positions of imaginary omnipotence while they watch from the comforts of their own homes?—and as a response to the nature of urban space itself and the dislocation from it felt by the urban subject.34 Yet in this denial of contingency lies a liberating moment wherein the city is re-enchanted through the individualizing of each journey; the city as “aura” is reclaimed through the sonic “tactics” of iPod users.

CASE STUDY: MUSIC IN THE EVERYDAY LIVES OF ELDERLY JAPANESE We draw on a study of music in the lives of thirty elderly Japanese people living in a care facility in Kobe, a city of approximately 1.5 million inhabitants in southern Japan. The data were collected through loosely structured, in-depth interviews.12 They covered topics such as musical tastes and preferences, social connection to music, and reactions to the music provided in the nursing home. Each interview also sought to explore the subject’s life soundtrack and his or her musical memories. These memories were in turn used to elicit autobiographical narratives. In what follows we draw only on those sections of interviews in which respondents described processes of envisioning place (“the West,” “Europe”) through music.

The first objective of the interviews was to explore music’s role in evoking long-term memories, as illustrated in this excerpt. Kiku was describing the emotions she associated with the song heard in Sannomiya: excitement about the encounter, happiness, contentment with family, nostalgia for the place where she grew up, and a feeling of shame about the ways the city had changed over 80 years. This emotional reminiscence was linked, for virtually all the respondents, to visualizations of the past. Subjects recounted how hearing music in the past was also often linked to visualization.

Both struggles were among the first, largest, and most sustained community-based movements to garner widespread public and political support and effectively challenge the islands' prevailing land and water oligarchy.1 In the antieviction struggle, diverse working-class people with little power or legal standing effectively shifted the issue from a singular private property dispute to broader matters of public land-use policies and disenfranchised citizenship rights.2 Drawing upon this success in the water struggle, multiethnic taro farmers rooted in Hawaiian tradition and culture effectively reinserted Native customary laws combined with America's public trust doctrine into Hawai‘i’s constitution and political practices.3 Finally, both of the struggles effectively mobilized a unique mix of multiethnic local, Native Hawaiian, and American identities and practices.4 Focusing on lessons learned from these seminal struggles, this chapter outlines the 1970s land struggle in Waiāhole and Waikāne valleys and provides an overview of the subsequent 1990s water struggle in Waiāhole, thus demonstrating the possibilities for—and practices of—local and Native control and use of land and water resources.

Almost everyone in this multiethnic and economically diverse community referred to themselves as country folks or as living a country life, and this was a sufficient basis for community identification (among many other identifications). This concept of country lifestyle—“keeping the country country”—served as a rallying point for the residents of Waiāhole-Waikāne and was incorporated into their four-point platform that proved salient for the rest of the island people: 1. Long-term leases at fair and reasonable rents. 2. Expand agriculture. 3. Preserve the integrity of the community and its lifestyle. 4. Provide for community involvement in regional planning.

activists formed a Marx-Lenin-Mao collective. As activist Pete Thompson put it, their focus was on “raising the level of political awareness and consciousness so that people are not naive, you know, about what it is that they're up against. And once they understand the terms of the struggle then you can move accordingly.” With designated point persons dispersed in different community struggles such as Waiāhole-Waikāne, the core activists regularly met to update each other, work out individual tactics and joint strategies, and mobilize a larger activist body as needed. Deploying a Marx-Lenin-Mao praxis enabled the various antieviction and antidevelopment struggles to be articulated as widespread system failings and not simply grievances between individuals and landlords or developers

In December 1974 the LUC ruled against the Marks-Pao rezoning request. The notion of preserving the community's agricultural integrity and rural lifestyle was ambiguous and thereby flexible, making it a salient concept that many people in Hawai‘i—including the LUC decision makers—could grasp and adopt as their own.

Residents even formed their own security force called Up in Arms, made up primarily of women. Members of Up in Arms wore helmets, boots, and armbands during demonstrations and courtroom proceedings. Their role was twofold: to counteract the intimidation residents felt because of significant police presence at such venues, and to maintain the discipline of WWCA so that the community was not misrepresented to the media and public.

What had this founder not known? • How much money it would take to complete the land development process before she could legally transfer title to each incoming community member. Sharon had no budget in advance, and no idea what it would cost to complete county requirements for a site plan and roads, utilities, etc. • How much each lot would eventually cost, and that she shouldn’t have fostered hope in those who could never afford to buy in. Sharon knew that some people in the group wouldn’t be able to buy in, but counted on her sense that “it will all work out somehow.” • That she’d need adequate legal documents and financial data to secure private financing. Sharon believed that telling potential financial contributors her spiritual vision for Gracelight was sufficient. It didn’t occur to her to provide a business plan, budget, or financial disclosure sheet, or to demonstrate to potential investors how and when they might get their money back. • That she should make it clear to everyone at the outset that as well as having a vision she was also serving as land developer. Sharon didn’t think of herself as a “developer,” and never used the term, in spite of the fact that she financed and was responsible for the purchase and development of the land. • That she needed to tell people that she fully intended to be reimbursed for her land-purchase and development costs and make a profit to compensate her time and entrepreneurial risk. Sharon didn’t think in terms like “entrepreneurial risk,” even though she was taking one. When group members in the first and second forming community groups finally brought up financial issues and asked pointed questions, she was offended. And group members were offended too, when they learned Sharon was going to make a profit. One can argue for or against making a profit on community land; the point is, Sharon didn’t make her intentions clear at the outset. • That she needed to tell people from the beginning that, as the developer, she would make all land-development decisions. Again, one can argue either way about one person making decisions about his or her own financial risks in forming a community — but Sharon should have made these clear. • That a process was needed for who was in the group and who wasn’t, and for what kinds of decisions the group would make and which Sharon alone would make. • That consensus was the wrong decision-making option for a group with no common vision or purpose, with one landowner and others with no financial risk, and with no clear distinction between those who were decision-making members of the group and those who were not. In fact, the group wasn’t practicing consensus at all, but rather some vaguely conceived idea of it.

WE SET OUT TO CHANGE OUR WORLD… by Roberta Wilson As fate would have it, Winslow Cohousing on Bainbridge Island near Seattle, formed in 1988, ended up being the first owner-developed cohousing community in the U.S. We certainly didn’t have much experience to go on. Only one of us had lived in an intentional community, and only a few had even visited any intentional communities. None of us had seen cohousing in Denmark, and of course there were no models of it close to home. What we had was McCamant and Durrett’s Cohousing book and an incredible amount of energy. As with all communities, we made some wise choices and some poor ones. We met every weekend for over two years, with many of us meeting in committees during the week. This vigorous schedule allowed us to buy land, get through the construction process, and move into our 30 duplexes and flats by Spring 1992, but it cost us potential members who couldn’t devote such time to development. Finding loans for what looked to financial institutions like some kind of middle-income commune was difficult and may have cost one credit union representative his job. The stress resulting from engaging some of our own members to work for us hurt the group and hurt some of these members as well. Our original group was deeply bonded by the sheer effort of the project. Yet, after move-in we retreated to our individual homes to recuperate. While our idealism had carried us through the forming stages, we weren’t quite prepared for the reality of living cooperatively — so many of us were used to having our own way in the world. We also had the inevitable turnover. We had problems with new residents who either had their own heroic notions, or who soared and then dove as the honeymoon phase ended. We had kids who couldn’t get along, a dog that bit, divorces and deaths, births and celebrations. For the most part, our surrounding neighbors were friendly. We figured out a work system, each serving on clusters — Administration, Process and Communication, Grounds, and Common Facilities. We figured out a meal system, with dinners five nights a week. We figured out how to work with consensus. We learned to keep good track of our finances, and we continued to work towards emotional literacy. We still struggle with issues such as member participation and how to make capital improvements, yet our meetings are now civil, efficient, and more emotionally honest. Folks have found their own level after the first years of feeling overwhelmed. Some of them have been disappointed with the lack of emotional intimacy, while others, especially teens, have felt uncomfortable living in a fishbowl. At times, most of us have probably asked ourselves, “What am I doing here?” — a question, I believe, that arises from a complex calculation of time and energy spent and one’s tolerance for conflict. Sometimes I’ve asked myself, after a difficult confrontation, why I should put so much of my life energy into something that seems, at the time, to give back little. Yet I’m sure that at other times each of us has surely declared: “I can’t imagine living anywhere else!” — a response to the very personal exchanges that make living in community so rewarding. I can call my neighbor and ask her to turn off the coffee pot that I forgot. Children come to visit and play with my dog. A neighbor pauses from her chores a moment and tells me about her life. In the forest, we scatter the ashes of a member who died; in our orchard, we bury the family dog. A neighbor’s sister comes to stay and offers massages. The children are delivered to school by adults who share the duty. Our community feels safe. The idealism, dreams, and devotion, while still here, have given ground to the practical and the real experience of living in community — the good, the bad, and the ugly. Community is seeping into our cells, I believe, so that even the challenges become just part of who we each are. Cooperative culture is gaining ground over our individual upbringing in competition; slowly, we are giving up the need for absolute control. We set out to change our world, and now community is changing us. Excerpted with permission from Communities
 Magazine, Spring 2000.

Given these “ingredients,” here’s my recipe for growing an intentional community: 1. Imagine, visualize, or feel something that doesn’t exist yet. 2. Inspire yourselves and those that join you to believe your particular vision is possible and you can make it happen. 3. Use entrepreneurial skills to do all this within your estimated budget and time frame (revising either as necessary). 4. Use labor, tools, and energy to create the physical expression of your vision on your property.

Mostly, however, I will go out of faith. Cohousing is now both my religion and my politics. I continue to ask myself “Is this best for the group?” before putting up my green “Yes” card in response to a proposal, because I sense we are creating something larger than mere housing here.

Gwen Kim, an allied activist involved in both the antieviction and water struggles, adds this: The main lesson from Waiāhole-Waikāne is that the latent untapped power of the people is so great. It's unbelievable how much power there is if we could just un-leash it, focus it…. The things that divide us now in the valley, or anywhere—we all have to look in terms of the larger picture…. I just believe with knowledge—it's so critical that we have knowledge—that with a lot of knowledge, combined with experience, I think we can win anything. We just have to have the strategy and the message and the love. If we lose the love, what is it all for? [laughter]…And hope.

The recently coined ‘ōlelo Hawai‘i word for colonization is kolonaio, meaning “crawling with worms.”4 One of the best ways to disempower a people is to burrow into their minds, infecting and incapacitating them at every level of consciousness, while simultaneously stripping them of their language—thereby erasing their historical memory and undermining their traditional knowledge systems. To add insult to injury, the colonizing power suppresses any meaningful use of the native language, yet perversely appropriates the native language and twists history for its benefit.

Cohousing communities have a slightly different process from other communities. Some additional key steps can include partnering with a developer, raising development financing, getting a construction loan, and securing individual mortgages. (See Chapter 12.) This is an increasingly popular model of intentional community in which people develop, build, and manage their own neighborhoods. They live in smaller-than-normal housing units and share ownership of community areas, usually including a common green, a garden space, and a large common building with a kitchen and dining room, children’s play area, laundry facilities, and guest rooms. Members optionally share dinners together several evenings a week, and usually make decisions by consensus.

MANY WAYS TO FORM COMMUNITY Property and Housing  • Buy or rent several houses on the same block and share backyards; turn one into a community building. • Buy or rent a large house and turn some of its rooms into common areas. • Rent apartments in an apartment building; turn one apartment into shared common community space. • Buy an apartment building (or buy several housing units in a planned community, condominium, or housing co-op) and do the same. • Buy land with an existing house or houses (or an office building, retail store, factory building, warehouse, theater, church, or motel) and turn it into housing and common areas. • Buy a former conference center or camp and do the same. • Buy raw land and start from scratch. Ownership  • The community can own the whole property and lease housing facilities or homesites to members. • Members can hold title to their individual housing units or lots and houses, and share ownership of common land and community buildings. Degree of Closeness  • Community members can be closely involved in each other’s lives — sharing living space or kitchens, living in close proximity, sharing equipment and tools, or having a car co-op. • Members can be less involved — living in separate housing units or in separate houses (in clustered housing, in more widely spaced but still clustered housing, or on separate lots), or sharing fewer resources in common. Degree of Financial Interdependence  • Community members can work for community businesses (and/or outside businesses), share incomes, and share a common treasury. • They can have a hybrid economy — working for community businesses and sharing profits for food, housing, medical insurance and other necessities, but keeping any outside earnings or assets separate. • They can have fully independent incomes, and share some or many community expenses

As a “punk” ideology, solarpunk must be opposed to the political domination of the old. But we may also have to live with it. We just aren’t likely to win the numbers game.

Cities also crystalize the social stressors modernity places on us. Solarpunk aesthetics look to loosen that vice with soothing visuals and textures that imply openness and pay homage to the living world. We can even build with materials that are themselves still living and growing with us. That is a beautiful vision, but one we must place in context. While it is useful to imagine comprehensively optimistic futures and fantasies, solar-punk can’t be the same as solar-utopia. Punks are an essentially anti-social (or at least counter-cultural) force, rejecting and attacking the norm. In this case that means understanding that the beautiful clothes and buildings solarpunk envisions are likely to be surrounded by something very different — the cracked concrete of decaying infrastructure, the smudged plastic of cheaply made gadgets, the intimidating glass and steel of finance fortresses.

But on the other side, there is the false seduction of favela ingenuity as well, that charmingly rickety sweet spot where Swiss Family Robinson meets Nat Geo poverty porn. It should go without saying that we should not fetishize slums. Still, it’s true that such places use resources more efficiently, that they successfully house millions with a relatively low carbon footprint. But I have two objections.

“Afraid of the sky” should be an easy one, right? Solar power turns climate disaster on its head by making the sky the source of energy abundance, not just superstorms, frozen winters and rains that never come. This is the high concept that drew me to this cause: what more elegant image of our salvation than a solar panel, turning the light that heats our planet beyond comfort into energy, the very commodity for which we set the world on fire?

As you world-build, ponder the whys of wearing fashions of joy as a response to global sorrow. Remember that cathedral-time decisions are minute compared to climate-scale momentum. Understand that solarpunk’s “dirt behind the ears” needs to come from planting something that will reclaim a bit of that carbon we burned. Hold your optimism up to the muggy, yellow light and make sure we are willing to work for it. For solarpunk to lead us towards a better future, it must look our climate sins in the eyes, acknowledge their gravity, and start fixing that carbon. There is no going back. Only slowly, steadily clawing our way through, to something better.

solarpunk can challenge the capitalist status quo by nurturing alternative economic arrangements at a community and network level. Encourage resiliency that insulates towns and neighborhoods from economic shocks. Forge mutal aid pacts that protect members from fiscal predation. If we can prove that we don’t need them or their money, the chokehold of the plutocracy will loosen.

Imagine a tree, growing amidst rubble, rooting around rocks into open spaces, occasionally pushing cracks wider. The tree can’t remove the concrete, but the concrete is too poorly maintained to stop it. In the same way I think solarpunk should work to reinvent civilization from within.

That doesn’t matter. I want no part of it. To yearn for the decimation of our people is an abomination.

Socialists look around us and we see the vast gap, not just between rich and poor, not just the wealth gap between black and white or the income gap between men and women or the power gap between bosses and workers, but the giant gap between what humans could be as a species and what we are. We are dreamers, and proudly so. We can have a debate about what kinds of policies we ought to adopt that best embody the socialist instinct, but I think we all have to agree that the instinct itself is the right one, and that those who apply the label to themselves are the most pragmatic and clear-eyed about the problems of our times.

One of the best ways for a group to experience a sense of community is to rent a rustic lodge with kitchen facilities for the weekend, with activities that might include preparing food and eating meals together, hiking and swimming, playing volleyball or other sports, making music and singing, and telling stories around the campfire. Storytelling is an excellent way to create intimacy on deeper levels, especially if the topics are self-revealing and personal. One way groups can do this is to tell their life stories, focusing especially on life-changing events or those that affected them deeply. Another is to ask each person to share for 20 minutes or so about the attitudes in their family of origin on such normally taboo subjects as religion, money, or social class.

“There are four mystical journeys,” Dhu said to him. “The first begins with gnosis and ends with fana, or passing away from all phenomenal things. The second begins when fana is succeeded by baqa, or abiding. At this point you journey in the real, by the real, to the real, and you yourself are a reality, a haqq. And after that you move on to the center of the spirit universe, and become one with all others who have done likewise.”

“You’d think everyone would join,” John said. “Yes, and they might, but it isn’t being offered to them. And that means it wasn’t a true utopia. We clever primate scientists were willing to carve out islands for ourselves, rather than work to create such conditions for everyone. And so in reality, the islands are part of the transnational order. They are paid for, they are never truly free, there is never a case of truly pure research. Because the people who pay for the scientist islands will eventually want a return on their investment. And now we are entering that time.

When they’ve never existed it’s hard to talk about them, hard to imagine them, because we don’t have the images. That’s always the problem when you try to make something new, and believe me I know, because I’ve been trying. But I think I can tell you what it will feel like—it will feel like the first years here, when we were a group and we all worked together.

the pleasure and stability of dining rooms had always occurred against such a backdrop, against the catastrophic background of universal chaos; such moments of calm were things as fragile and transitory as soap bubbles, destined to burst almost as soon as they blew into existence. Groups of friends, rooms, streets, years, none of them would last. The illusion of stability was created by a concerted effort to ignore the chaos they were imbedded in. And so they ate, and talked, and enjoyed each other’s company; this was the way it had been in the caves, on the savannah, in the tenements and the trenches and the cities huddling under bombardment.

making a conceptualization of utopias realistic should not limit the radical terrain within which the utopian spirit unfolds; it should merely foreclose its inherent totalitarian dangers. This is possible by conceptualizing realistic utopia as an open-ended process of utopian visioning within a democratic, pluralistic context; a conception which in fact shares much in common with the normative theory of deliberative democracy.

First, the very act of idealized theorizing “is open to the accusation of authoritarianism” in that the theorist implicitly claims “a privileged position vis-` a-vis those addressed by the theory.”15 A perfect utopia can no longer be changed for the better, for the attribute “perfect” carries with it the notion of “without any mistake” and hence “beyond the need for change.”16 Such an idea of fixing the world once and for all can be seen as dangerously undermining the role of politics as an ongoing project, as well as any room for critique and contestation. 17 Thus, even if hypothetically everyone at the time agreed with a particular utopian vision of society, regarding it as the one perfect — and hence uncriticizable — society might be considered an authoritarian move. A similar contradiction inheres in the idea of the implementation of a perfect society. To the extent that authoritarianism is considered inherently problematic, and room for critique therefore a vital normative demand in modern societies, a vision that does not respect this cannot be good, let alone perfect. Attempting to implement a utopian vision is bound to have problematic consequences. The implementation of a perfect society, for it to be perceived as perfect by every member, requires either the support of all or the suppression of some citizens. 18 Given the diversity of and disagreement over conceptions of the good, for Popper, any attempt at imposing a supposedly perfect vision for society thus implies that any alternatives, criticisms, or changes in preferences must be suppressed, resulting in the emergence of “a strong, centralized rule of a few.”19 Based on these common critiques, two aspects have to be distinguished. On the one hand, utopias are rejected because there seems to be something inherently authoritarian about even the act of utopian thinking. On the other hand, it is the consequences of utopian thought that are feared.Indeed, it is clear that an implementation of a utopian vision can imply harmful consequences such as the forceful suppression of critique and opposition. Yet this would not yet imply a rejection of utopian thought as such. Suppose an ideal vision happens to be accepted as such by all those affected by it. In this case, its expression does not result in any harmful consequences related to shutting down critique or punishing those who object. Would this still constitute an act of authoritarianism? Leaving aside the empirical questions of how full acceptance by all could be established and whether it would be likely, the reason why utopian thought as such seems authoritarian is that it appears to deny the very possibility of critique both in the present and into the future. Inasmuch as it is effective in doing so purely through its being presented as a perfect vision, it is not just its tangible consequences, but its being granted a general status of being uncriticizable that makes it an instance of authoritarianism.Yet, while authoritarian expressions may be objectionable, they are not harmful unless they are effective at shutting down possible objections and imposing their vision. A status of uncriticizable perfection, while claimed by the utopian, thus at least partly depends on its acceptance as such by the audience; otherwise it would consist not inherently in the conceptualization, but, again, in a consequence of utopian thought, namely that of suppressing a critique that would have otherwise been voiced. As such, whether or not there is any effective (as opposed to objectionable-yet-harmless) authoritarianism depends on the circumstances within which the utopia is expressed and received, rather than on the very act of conceptualizing it as such. If this is so, there does not seem to be any inherent authoritarianism (at least in a problematic sense) in the conceptualization of utopias at all, but only in its possible, but not necessary, consequences. This is an important distinction to make in that the mere conceptualization and expression of utopian visions is not only not necessarily harmful, but it can also fulfill important political functions as instances of social critique.Crucially, as I argue in the following, utopian thought fulfills this function not in spite of, but precisely because of its radical content that ignores existing assumptions and feasibility constraints. The hope embodied in utopian dreaming20 implies an alert attitude towards suboptimal realities, in the sense that hope for a better society is preceded by an understanding of what is wrong in the present one. Utopias are thus “not simply pleasant day-dreams, but, in fact, the embodiment, the crystallization, of the entire Weltanschauung [worldview] of the author,”21 containing profound messages about the state of society. 22 Against the critique of utopias as authoritarian, this view responds that utopian visions should not in fact be understood as faultless models according to which society could or should be rebuilt here and now,23 but rather as contributions to a stock of reflective and critical thought within society. For this, “[w]hat matters is that the utopian experiment disrupts the taken-for-granted nature of the present and proffers an alternative set of values.”24 Through this disruption of taken-for-grantedness, utopias, in contrast to discouraging opposition, in fact open up a political space for critique; for taken-forgrantedness can itself be regarded as an instance, or symptom, of totalizing imposition. Questioning takenfor-granted “social facts” can have the double effect not only of exploring which actual alternatives lie beyond what is currently thought to be feasible but thereby also making existing arrangements appear in a different light and possibly no longer the only imaginable society.

From this perspective, political thought strictly set on staying within the limits of existing feasibility constraints risks contributing to a “cynical realism” that capitulates to such realities when change might in fact be possible. 27 While a utopian perfect society (arguably) implies the suppression of critical judgment, one without any utopian visioning also lacks critical perspectives, which makes it similarly prone to totalizing threats. Utopian thought challenges such cynical realism in that it works as a device to “defamiliarize the familiar,”28 which enables a critical problematization of reality in the first place. In other words, while progress as such may not require visions as radical as utopian ones, and could be sparked by normal political proposals for some reform, it is, on this view, precisely — and only — the complete and unconstrained re-imagination of the whole society that makes true critique possible. 29 From this perspective, although critics of utopia are bound to be right that an attempted implementation of a utopian society is likely to lead to authoritarianism, utopian thought itself is also vital for the critique of authoritarian impositions of mainstream views and supposed facts.Thus, these arguments reinforce the position that while the implementation of a utopian vision is always authoritarian, the mere conceptualization of utopias has an ambiguous nature. It might seem to indicate an authoritarian attitude, yet it also contributes to an atmosphere in which more subtle authoritarian impositions can be challenged in the first place.Hence, conceptualizing utopias is not necessarily authoritarian in its effect; it is possible that its critical impact is larger than its authoritarian impact. This suggests that what makes a utopian vision authoritarian is not the unrealistic nature of its substantive content as such, but only the harmful consequences of claiming — and being effectively granted — total validity for it. An implementation of utopian visions must always be authoritarian, because it is precisely the determination to enforce one’s fixed vision (in disregard of any political, let alone democratic process) that embodies such a claim to total validity. Yet a mere conceptualization of utopian visions is authoritarian only to the extent that it effectively claims total validity, and regardless of the extent to which it is unrealistic in a practical sense.Hence, to disarm the authoritarian element of utopian visioning, either the utopian has to refrain from claiming perfection and thus total validity; or, since what matters is an effective, that is, consequential, claim to total validity, the context within which the utopia is expressed and the way it is received must be able to resist any such claim. Neither of these options implies any limitations to the substantive content of the utopia; and the authoritarian harmfulness of a utopian vision need not necessarily depend exclusively on characteristics of the utopia itself. Against this backdrop, the following conceptual discussion of realistic utopias seeks out a way between the dangers and the political importance of utopias. I will conclude that it is in fact utopian thought itself, conceived of as a realistic meta-utopia, that is the best safeguard against totalitarianism. In the remainder of this article I discuss how the meaning of realistic utopia can be fruitfully understood in this sense.III. Realistic Utopias A seeming contradiction in terms, the term realistic utopia has become a popular concept to denote a compromise between the dangers and the useful sides of utopia. Theorists using this concept seek to reap the best of the two worlds of practically orientated realistic theorizing that takes account of the real constraints in society as it is, and ideal theorizing based on unconstrained reasoning. Yet utopias are unrealistic in different ways. The following section distinguishes between three main types of realistic utopia. Based on a discussion of the different uses of the concept in the extant literature, I argue that realistic utopia is best understood as promoting utopian thought while foreclosing the danger of authoritarian consequences, and argue that none of the existing realistic utopias in the literature achieve this. I show how the “most truly realistic” Type III realistic utopia goes beyond the ways in which this concept has been used so far, and discuss how it can be conceptualized based on this analysis.III.1. Three Types of Realistic Utopias What does it mean for a utopia to be realistic? On the one hand, the term realistic is often understood to refer to the likelihood or ease with which a vision is implemented. For this, one should be realistic about human abilities, existing preferences, existing institutions and so on. Two main approaches can be distinguished here, which I term realistic utopias types I and II.

threats. Utopian thought challenges such cynical realism in that it works as a device to “defamiliarize the familiar,”28 which enables a critical problematization of reality in the first place. In other words, while progress as such may not require visions as radical as utopian ones, and could be sparked by normal political proposals for some reform, it is, on this view, precisely — and only — the complete and unconstrained re-imagination of the whole society that makes true critique possible. 29 From this perspective, although critics of utopia are bound to be right that an attempted implementation of a utopian society is likely to lead to authoritarianism, utopian thought itself is also vital for the critique of authoritarian impositions of mainstream views and supposed facts.Thus, these arguments reinforce the position that while the implementation of a utopian vision is always authoritarian, the mere conceptualization of utopias has an ambiguous nature. It might seem to indicate an authoritarian attitude, yet it also contributes to an atmosphere in which more subtle authoritarian impositions can be challenged in the first place.Hence, conceptualizing utopias is not necessarily authoritarian in its effect; it is possible that its critical impact is larger than its authoritarian impact. This suggests that what makes a utopian vision authoritarian is not the unrealistic nature of its substantive content as such, but only the harmful consequences of claiming — and being effectively granted — total validity for it. An implementation of utopian visions must always be authoritarian, because it is precisely the determination to enforce one’s fixed vision (in disregard of any political, let alone democratic process) that embodies such a claim to total validity. Yet a mere conceptualization of utopian visions is authoritarian only to the extent that it effectively claims total validity, and regardless of the extent to which it is unrealistic in a practical sense.Hence, to disarm the authoritarian element of utopian visioning, either the utopian has to refrain from claiming perfection and thus total validity; or, since what matters is an effective, that is, consequential, claim to total validity, the context within which the utopia is expressed and the way it is received must be able to resist any such claim. Neither of these options implies any limitations to the substantive content of the utopia; and the authoritarian harmfulness of a utopian vision need not necessarily depend exclusively on characteristics of the utopia itself. Against this backdrop, the following conceptual discussion of realistic utopias seeks out a way between the dangers and the political importance of utopias. I will conclude that it is in fact utopian thought itself, conceived of as a realistic meta-utopia, that is the best safeguard against totalitarianism. In the remainder of this article I discuss how the meaning of realistic utopia can be fruitfully understood in this sense.III. Realistic Utopias A seeming contradiction in terms, the term realistic utopia has become a popular concept to denote a compromise between the dangers and the useful sides of utopia. Theorists using this concept seek to reap the best of the two worlds of practically orientated realistic theorizing that takes account of the real constraints in society as it is, and ideal theorizing based on unconstrained reasoning. Yet utopias are unrealistic in different ways. The following section distinguishes between three main types of realistic utopia. Based on a discussion of the different uses of the concept in the extant literature, I argue that realistic utopia is best understood as promoting utopian thought while foreclosing the danger of authoritarian consequences, and argue that none of the existing realistic utopias in the literature achieve this. I show how the “most truly realistic” Type III realistic utopia goes beyond the ways in which this concept has been used so far, and discuss how it can be conceptualized based on this analysis.III.1. Three Types of Realistic Utopias What does it mean for a utopia to be realistic? On the one hand, the term realistic is often understood to refer to the likelihood or ease with which a vision is implemented. For this, one should be realistic about human abilities, existing preferences, existing institutions and so on. Two main approaches can be distinguished here, which I term realistic utopias types I and II. Type I aims to be more realistic than a traditional utopia by limiting the scope of the utopian vision to what is possible here and now.

Of course all the genetic templates for our new biota are Terran; the minds designing them are Terran; but the terrain is Martian. And terrain is a powerful genetic engineer, determining what flourishes and what doesn’t, pushing along progressive differentiation, and thus the evolution of new species. And as the generations pass, all the members of a biosphere evolve together, adapting to their terrain in a complex communal response, a creative self-designing ability.

“Now as Daly said, man-made capital and natural capital are not substitutable. This is obvious, but since most economists still say they are substitutable, it has to be insisted on. Put simply, you can’t substitute more sawmills for fewer forests. If you’re building a house you can juggle the number of power saws and carpenters, which means they’re substitutable, but you can’t build it with half the amount of lumber, no matter how many saws or carpenters you have.

Desmond laughed at him as he tried to express this, and irritably he exclaimed, “But why else take on such compromised work, if not to that end?” “Power,” Desmond said. “Power and gain.” “Ah.” Sax had always been so uninterested in those things that it was hard for him to understand why anyone else would be. What was personal gain but the freedom to do what you wanted to do? And what was power but the freedom to do what you wanted to do? And once you had that freedom, any more wealth or power actually began to restrict one’s options, and reduce one’s freedom. One became a servant of one’s wealth or power, constrained to spend all one’s time protecting it. So that properly seen, the freedom of a scientist with a lab at his command was the highest freedom possible. Any more wealth and power only interfered with that. Desmond was shaking his head as Sax described this philosophy. “Some people like to tell others what to do. They like that more than freedom. Hierarchy, you know. And their place in the hierarchy. As long as it’s high enough. Everyone bound into their places. It’s safer than freedom. And a lot of people are cowards.”

Making space for political depression and failure does not equate to nihilism, apathy, or resignation.Indeed, learning to feel our grief together and to work with political depression and failure may help enable the entangled, more-than-human communities of care that will make still possible cities worth having—and may, perhaps, lead us back to hope through practices, as Head (2016) suggests. In the words of Nēhiyaw philosopher Erica Violet Lee (2016, para.35): To provide care in the wastelands is about gathering enough love to turn devastation into mourning and then, maybe, turn that mourning into hope. But if not, well, you’ll fnd me caring in and for wastelands anyway. What else am I going to do? Notes 1. From Lauren Berlant (2011, 1): ‘A relation of cruel optimism exists when something you desire is actually an obstacle to your fourishing. It might involve food, or a kind of love; it might be a fantasy of the good life, or a political project’ (emphasis added).2. Slogan drawn from the Public Feelings feel tank—see Berlant (2012).3. The Darkest Timeline is a meme based on a kind of multirealism, emerging out of the television show Community. From Know Your Meme (2017): ‘The Darkest Timeline is a reference to the multi-verse theory which hypothesises that there are multiple universes outside of our own in which all things are possible, and that we live in the worst possible of these universes. ’ 4.(Halberstam 2011, 88).5.(Haraway in Terranova 2016).6.(Graham 2018).7. In researching this paper I started typing the phrase into Google, and the second suggested autofll result (the frst just completed the ‘think global act local’ phrase) was ‘think global act local coca cola’. This seems damning.8. In fact, given the near permanence of many of these artefacts—including our toxic, plastic progeny, in Heather Davis’s parlance, which are already ‘queering our bodies’ (2015, 237)—we may need to think of them, and ‘fossil-beings … as a kind of kin’, to knit them into ‘de-weaponised’ relations and include them in our understandings of our responsibilities and obligations to places and each other (Todd 2017, 107).9.(maree brown 2017, 197).10. Of place, they write: ‘it is also the scale of relationship, reciprocity, and respect across the manifold ontological styles of pluriverse … place provides the impetus for the protocols of pluralism’ (Larsen and Johnson 2017, 186).11. ‘ … or that feeling bad is a state that precludes feelings of hope and joy’ (Cvetkovich 2012, 206).

62 • International Journal of Critical Pedagogy Racial Belonging White people enjoy a deeply internalized, largely unconscious sense of racial belonging in U.S. society (DiAngelo, 2006b; McIntosh, 1988). This racial belonging is instilled via the whiteness embedded in the culture at large. Everywhere we look, we see our own racial image reﬂected back to us – in our heroes and heroines, in standards of beauty, in our role-models and teachers, in our textbooks and historical memory, in the media, in religious iconography including the image of god himself, etc. In virtually any situation or image deemed valuable in dominant society, whites belong. Indeed, it is rare for most whites to experience a sense of not belonging, and such experiences are usually very temporary, easily avoidable situations. Racial belonging becomes deeply internalized and taken for granted. In dominant society, interruption of racial belonging is rare and thus destabilizing and frightening to whites. Whites consistently choose and enjoy racial segregation. Living, working, and playing in racial segregation is unremarkable as long as it is not named or made explicitly intentional. For example, in many anti-racist endeavors, a common exercise is to separate into caucus groups by race in order to discuss issues specifc to your racial group, and without the pressure or stress of other groups’ presence. Generally, people of color appreciate this opportunity for racial fellowship, but white people typically become very uncomfortable, agitated and upset - even though this temporary separation is in the service of addressing racism. Responses include a disorienting sense of themselves as not just people, but most particularly white people; a curious sense of loss about this contrived and temporary separation which they don’t feel about the real and on-going segregation in their daily lives; and anxiety about not knowing what is going on in the groups of color. The irony, again, is that most whites live in racial segregation every day, and in fact, are the group most likely to intentionally choose that segregation (albeit obscured in racially coded language such as seeking “good schools” and “good neighborhoods”). This segregation is unremarkable until it is named as deliberate – i.e. “We are now going to separate by race for a short exercise.”

At the same time, white people often need to reﬂect upon racial information and be allowed to make connections between the information and their own lives. Educators can encourage and support white participants in making their engagement a point of analysis. White Fragility doesn’t always manifest in overt ways; silence and withdrawal are also functions of fragility. Who speaks, who doesn’t speak, when, for how long, and with what emotional valence are all keys to understanding the relational patterns that hold oppression in place (Gee, 1999; Powell, 1997). Viewing white anger, defensiveness, silence, and withdrawal in response to issues of race through the framework of White Fragility may help frame the problem as an issue of stamina-building, and thereby guide our interventions accordingly.

Astounding, really, that Michel could consider psychology any kind of science at all. So much of it consisted of throwing together. Of thinking of the mind as a steam engine, the mechanical analogy most ready to hand during the birth of modern psychology. People had always done that when they thought about the mind: clockwork for Descartes, geological changes for the early Victorians, computers or holography for the twentieth century, AIs for the twenty-first…and for the Freudian traditionalists, steam engines. Application of heat, pressure buildup, pressure displacement, venting, all shifted into repression, sublimation, the return of the repressed. Sax thought it unlikely steam engines were an adequate model for the human mind. The mind was more like—what?—an ecology—a fellfield—or else a jungle, populated by all manner of strange beasts. Or a universe, filled with stars and quasars and black holes. Well—a bit grandiose, that—really it was more like a complex collection of synapses and axons, chemical energies surging hither and yon, like weather in an atmosphere. That was better—weather—storm fronts of thought, high-pressure zones, low-pressure cells, hurricanes—the jet streams of biological desires, always making their swift powerful rounds…life in the wind. Well. Throwing together. In fact the mind was poorly understood.

If democracy and self-rule are the fundamentals, then why should people give up these rights when they enter their workplace? In politics we fight like tigers for freedom, for the right to elect our leaders, for freedom of movement, choice of residence, choice of what work to pursue—control of our lives, in short. And then we wake up in the morning and go to work, and all those rights disappear. We no longer insist on them. And so for most of the day we return to feudalism. That is what capitalism is—a version of feudalism in which capital replaces land, and business leaders replace kings. But the hierarchy remains. And so we still hand over our lives’ labor, under duress, to feed rulers who do no real work.”

As if history were a tapestry, and the congress the loom where everything was coming together, the present moment with its miraculous thereness, its potential right in their own atoms, their own voices. Looking back at the past, able to see it all, a single long braided tapestry of events; looking forward at the future, able to see none of it, though presumably it branched out in an explosion of threads of potentiality, and could become anything: they were two different kinds of unreachable immensity. And all of them traveling together, from the one into the other, through that great loom the present, the now.

As people learn more, they understand better their dependence on each other and on their world. On Mars we have seen that the best way to express this interdependence is to live for giving, in a culture of compassion. Every person free and equal in the sight of all, working together for the good of all. It’s that work that makes us most free. No hierarchy is worth acknowledging but this one: the more we give, the greater we become. Now in the midst of a great flood, spurred by the great flood, we see the flowering of this culture of compassion, emerging on both the two worlds at once.”

The green alps had been cleared of trees and stones—in their original state they had been forests. So they were terraformed spaces, huge hilly lawns that had been created to provide forage for cattle. Such an agriculture had not made economic sense as capitalism defined it, but the Swiss had supported the high farms anyway, because they thought it was important, or beautiful, or both at once. It was Swiss. “There are values higher than economic values,” Vlad had insisted back in the congress on Mars, and Nirgal saw now how there were people on Earth who had always believed that, at least in part. Werteswandel, they were saying down in Bern, mutation of values; but it could as well be evolution of values, return of values; gradual change, rather than punctuated equilibrium; benevolent residual archaisms, which endured and endured, until slowly these high isolated mountain valleys had taught the world how to live, their big farmhouses floating by on green waves.

The legislature was passing the laws of eco-economics, fleshing out the bones drawn up in the constitution. They directed co-ops that had existed before the revolution to help the newly independent metanat local subsidiaries to transform themselves into similar cooperative organizations. This process, called horizontalization, had very wide support, especially from the young natives, and so it was proceeding fairly smoothly. Every Martian business now had to be owned by its employees only. No co-op could exceed one thousand people; larger enterprises had to be made of co-op associations, working together. For their internal structures most of the firms chose variants of the Bogdanovist models, which themselves were based on the cooperative Basque community of Mondragon, Spain. In these firms all employees were co-owners, and they bought into their positions by paying the equivalent of about a year’s wages to the firm’s equity fund, wages earned in apprentice programs of various kinds at the end of schooling. This buy-in fee became the starter of their share in the firm, which grew every year they stayed, until it was given back to them as pension or departure payment. Councils elected from the workforce hired management, usually from outside, and this management then had the power to make executive decisions, but was subject to a yearly review by the councils. Credit and capital were obtained from central cooperative banks, or the global government’s start-up fund, or helper organizations such as Praxis and the Swiss. On the next level up, co-ops in the same industries or services were associating for larger projects, and also sending representatives to industry guilds, which established professional practice boards, arbitration and mediation centers, and trade associations

He spent the afternoon and the next day wandering, sitting on flat rocks and watching the little rivulets bounce downstream. Once he remembered how fast water had fallen on Earth. Unnatural. No. But this was his place, known and loved, every dyad and every clump of campion, even the speed of water as it lofted off stone and plashed down in its smooth silver shapes. The way moss felt under the finger pads. His visitors were people for whom Mars was forever an idea, a nascent state, a political situation. They lived in the tents and they might as well have been in a city anywhere, and their devotion, while real, was given to some cause or idea, some Mars of the mind. Which was fine. But for Nirgal now it was the land that mattered, the places where water arrived just so, trickling over the billion-year-old rock onto pads of new moss. Leave politics to the young, he had done his part. He didn’t want to do anymore. Or at least he wanted to wait until Jackie was gone. Power was like Hiroko, after all—it always slipped away.

Capitalism then was composed of clashing elements of the residual feudalism, and an emergent future order that was only now being defined in their own time, which Charlotte called democracy. And now, Charlotte claimed, they were, on Mars at least, in the democratic age itself. Capitalism had therefore, like all other ages, been the combination of two systems in very sharp opposition to each other. This incompatibility of its constituent parts was underlined by the unfortunate experience of capitalism’s critical shadow, socialism, which had theorized true democracy, and called for it, but in the attempt to enact it had used the methods at hand in its time, the same feudal methods so prevalent in capitalism itself; so that both versions of the mix had ended up about as destructive and unjust as their common residual parent. The feudal hierarchies in capitalism had been mirrored in the lived socialist experiments; and so the whole era had remained a highly charged chaotic struggle, exhibiting several different versions of the dynamic struggle between feudalism and democracy

And then the feeling came on her again, the pre-epileptic aura of the presque vu, the sea glittering, a vast significance suffusing everything, immanent everywhere but just beyond reach, pressing in on things—and with a little pop she got it—that that very aspect of the phenomenon was itself the meaning—that the significance of everything always lay just out of reach, in the future, tugging them forward—that in special moments one felt this tidal tug of becoming as a sensation of sharp happy anticipation, as she had when looking down on Mars from the Ares, the unconscious mind filled not with the detritus of a dead past but with the unforeseeable possibilities of the live future, ah, yes—anything could happen, anything, anything.

Experimentation had made it clear that large-scale collective quantum phenomena were happening in every brain; there existed in the brain both global quantum coherence, and quantum entanglement between the various electrical states of the microtubules; and this meant that all the counterintuitive phenomena and sheer paradox of quantum reality were an integral part of consciousness.

distinctive feature of anarchism, as a political movement, is that it roots itself not in a fixed epistemological schema, e.g. , a set of propositions about the true structure of history, capital, patriarchy, etc. , but in an ethical stance, the positive side of which consists in a fundamental affirmation of freedom, equality, and the coexistence of the different not only as ends but as means, the negative side of which consists in a fundamental refusal of domination and hierarchy per se, not only as instanced in relations of class or gender or race, etc. , but in any and all relationship (Graeber 2004a:5- 6; Granier I.3.3B, translation mine). Anarchists oppose domination as such, not only insofar as this presents itself as the effect or byproduct of some supposedly fundamental category: ‘Slavery may change its form or its name – its essence remains the same’ (Bakunin 1972: 137).Thus, from the time of Proudhon on, anarchists have regarded not only Capital, the State, and the Church as analogous enemies (with overlapping interests), but also patriarchy, racism, colonialism, heterosexism, and so on, on the same ethical grounds (Colson 2001: 24, translation mine). Marxist theory presents itself as ‘science’ – as an ‘analytical discourse’ which describes how history progresses, or how capital works, or how class society is structured (Graeber 2004a: 6). By contrast, as Daniel Colson remarks, anarchist theory ‘is above all an ethical project which directly engages, in its least practice, in judging the value of relations and situations’ (2001: 108, translation mine; May and Lance 983-84). This ethics refuses to locate the desired good in some utopian elsewhere or elsewhen, in the afterlife or after the revolution, a deferral which authorizes the dualism of ‘ends’ versus ‘means’ (and, as Colson notes, ‘the mastery over time that this distinction presupposes’) but insists that means contain their own ends, that a genuinely transformative movement ‘prefigures’ the society it seeks to bring about in its practices116

Since an anarchist ethical stance means both a refusal to dominate and a refusal to be dominated, an ethical approach to the text cannot simply mean a receptive or empathetic reading, in which we merely submit to its terms, nor can it mean a purely active reading, reading as the ‘use’ or violent ‘appropriation’ of the text; instead of positing ourselves as the slaves or the masters of texts, we ought to place ourselves into a dynamic relation with them, to see each encounter with them as a dialogue fraught

If I simply dominate the text, supplying all its meaning, then my perspective can never be changed or enriched by reading, and the ‘me’ remains (falsely) absolute; if I cannot contribute to the construction of meaning, however, then the text cannot tell me anything – unless, in fact, I substitute for the text as it exists, with all its possibilities, a preconceived interpretation, generally a received, traditional, rigidly conventional reading, as in the case of fundamentalist readings of the Torah, Bible, or Koran. In the latter case, I submit to the ‘transcendent’ authority of ‘a vicariate, a priesthood … [i.e. , a] Logos’; in the former case, I enclose myself in a ‘narcissism’ or solipsism for which ‘everything can be made up, finally nothing is given, there are no facts’ (Dadoun 1997, translation mine; Proudhon 1935: III.363, translation mine; Goodman 1964b: 81). Only if the text and I can each contest one another, call one another into question, can there be an exercise of the ‘collective reason’ which permits freedom to coexist with community. Thus the necessity of a ‘reading … with double intent,’ from perspectives which are internal to the text and from perspectives external to them, of reading with ‘sympathy and empathy’ and of ‘look[ing] for what hides behind discourses’ (de Cleyre 1914: 379-380; Read 1967: 9; Granier 2003: II, ‘Introduction,’ translation mine). Through such a ‘double labour,’ we come not only to ‘construct’ the text that we ‘apprehend,’ but to ‘respect’ it, to allow it the opportunity to reconstruct ourselves: ‘we make it at the same time that it makes us’ (Dadoun 1997; Landauer 1974: 42, translations mine).8. The positive face of anarchism entails a theory of textual meaning as relationship – specifically, of textual meaning as that which emerges from two sets of relations: a. ) the relations between the text and the forces which produced it within a given situation, and b. ) the relations between the text as a force and its possible effects or uses in particular situations. Since ‘the fact and the idea are really inseparable,’ it follows that we can interpret them: ‘From all these facts, let us draw out the general idea’ (Proudhon 1935: II.298, III.71, translation mine). This ‘general idea’ or ‘logic of things’ (Proudhon 1935: I.192, translation mine) can be thought in terms of a notion shared by Proudhon, Bakunin, and Kropotkin, namely, that of the ‘resultant. ’ In Proudhon’s words, ‘everywhere there is a group, there is a resultant which is the power of the120

By ‘life,’ we mean not only the actual but the plural potentials which are dormant within it.‘Life,’ here, is to be thought in fully natural, ecological terms, as ‘a vast, complicated whole,’ ‘a world of becoming and transition in which multiple diversities coexist, a world of the never-completed, of the incalculable and the inextricable’; it is a process of ‘uninterrupted creation’ (Voline 2005, 434-435; Landauer 1974: 77, translation mine). This living reality is conceived of as comprising both ‘actuality,’ that which is, and ‘potentialities,’ that which could be; the real cannot be reduced to either without falsification (Bookchin 1996: 21; Clark 1976: 27-28; McLaughlin 2002: 104-106; Graeber 2001, Toward an Anthropological Theory 52, 260). There is no potential which does not emerge from some concrete actuality; conversely, there is no actuality which does not harbour multiple potentialities, a ‘multitude of modes of being and possibilities,’ even if some of these possibilities are indeed ‘monstrous’ (Bookchin 1971: 284; Colson 2004: 12, Colson 2001: 246; Cochrane 2000: 168).

This bloody history implies that, to be thoroughgoing and successful, an anarchist revolution would have to be global. Capitalism is a global system, constantly expanding and colonizing every autonomous society it encounters. In the long run, no one community or country can remain anarchist while the rest of the world is capitalist. An anti-capitalist revolution must destroy capitalism totally, or else be destroyed. This does not mean that anarchism must be a single global system. Many different forms of anarchist society could coexist, and these in turn could coexist with societies that were not anarchist, so long as the latter were not confrontationally authoritarian or oppressive.

To this end, here are some recurring themes that may be beneficial to reflect on in the course of reading this book: Isolation: Many anarchist projects work quite well, but only make an impact in the lives of a tiny number of people. What engenders this isolation? What tends to contribute to it, and what can offset it? Alliances: In a number of examples, anarchists and other anti-authoritarians were betrayed by supposed allies who sabotaged the possibility of liberation in order to gain power for themselves. Why did anarchists choose these alliances, and what can we learn about what kind of alliances to make today? Repression: Autonomous communities and revolutionary activities have been stopped cold by police repression or military invasion time after time.

In cases where we could find no one from the community in question to review and criticize our own interpretations, we have tried to situate the storyteller in the telling, to subvert his or her objectivity and invisibility, to deliberately challenge the validity of our own information, and to propose representations that are flexible and humble. We don’t know exactly how to accomplish this balancing act, but our hope is to learn while trying.

One economy developed over and over by humans on every continent has been the gift economy. In this system, if people have more than they need of anything, they give it away. They don’t assign value, they don’t count debts. Everything you don’t use personally can be given as a gift to someone else, and by giving more gifts you inspire more generosity and strengthen the friendships that keep you swimming in gifts too. Many gift economies lasted for thousands of years, and proved much more effective at enabling all of the participants to meet their needs.

It was considered “punan,” or taboo, for members of Semai society to calculate the value of gifts given or received. Other commonly held rules of etiquette included the duty to share whatever they had that they did not immediately need, and the duty to share with guests and anyone who asked. It was punan not to share or to refuse a request, but also to ask for more than someone could give.

It seems that in all known gift economies, even the laziest of people were never refused food — in stark contrast to capitalism — but feeding a few loafers is an insignificant drain on a society’s resources, especially when compared to pampering the voracious elite of our society. And losing this tiny amount of resources is far preferable to losing our compassion and letting people starve to death.

And losing this tiny amount of resources is far preferable to losing our compassion and letting people starve to death. In more extreme cases, if members of such a society were more aggressively parasitic, attempting to monopolize resources or force other people to work for them — in other words, acting like capitalists — they could be ostracized and even expelled from the society.

the game began like a tug-of-war match, with the women pulling one end of a long rope or vine and the men pulling the other. But as soon as one side started to win, someone from that team would run to the other side, also symbolically changing their gender and becoming a member of the other group. By the end, the participants collapsed in a heap laughing, all having changed their genders multiple times. Neither side “won,” but that seemed to be the point. Group harmony was restored.

According to Robert Dentan, a Western anthropologist who lived with them, “little violence occurs within Semai society. Violence, in fact, seems to terrify the Semai. A Semai does not meet force with force, but with passivity or flight. Yet, he has no institutionalized way of preventing violence — no social controls, no police or courts. Somehow a Semai learns automatically always to keep tight rein over his aggressive impulses.”

Half a century ago, anthropologist Pierre Clastres concluded that the stateless and anti-authoritarian societies he studied in South America were not holdouts from a primordial era, as other Westerners had assumed. He argued that, on the contrary, they were well aware of the possible emergence of the state, and they were organizing themselves to prevent this. It turns out that many of them were in fact post-state societies founded by refugees and rebels who had fled from or overthrown earlier states.

Westerners who see themselves as the pinnacle of human evolution typically view hunter-gatherers and other stateless peoples as relics of the past, even if they are alive in the present. In doing so, they are presuming that history is an inevitable progression from less to more complex, and that Western civilization is more complex than other cultures. If history is organized into the Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age, Industrial Age, Information Age, and so on, someone who does not use metal tools must still be living in the Stone Age, right? But it is eurocentric, to say the least, to assume that a hunter-gatherer who knows the uses of a thousand different plants is less sophisticated than an operator at a nuclear power plant who knows how to push a thousand different buttons but doesn’t know where his food comes from.

One might say selfishness is natural, in that people inevitably live according to their own desires and experiences. But egoism need not be competitive or dismissive of others. Our relationships extend far beyond our bodies and our minds — we live in communities, depend on ecosystems for food and water, and need friends, families, and lovers for our emotional health. Without institutionalized competition and exploitation, a person’s self-interest overlaps with the interests of her community and her environment.

Friendship is precious because it is a space in which we interact as equals, where our opinions are valued regardless of our social status. Groups of friends typically use informal consensus to decide how to spend time together, organize activities, assist one another, and respond to challenges in their daily lives.

Accordingly, the Uniform Unincorporated Nonprofit Association Act (UUNAA) was drafted by a National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws. This particular model act addresses the following sticky questions:  Who has the authority to acquire, hold, and transfer property on behalf of an unincorporated association?  Who can sue on behalf of the entity?  Who can be sued if the entity engages in actions that result in civil liability?  Who has the right to enter into contracts on behalf of the entity? The UUNAA was drafted with the small, informal associations in mind. If your nonprofit falls into this category, it may not have ready access to legal advice. So the UUNAA is a good source of legal answers for your organization. You can find a copy of the Act at www.muridae.com/nporegulation/documents/unincorp_assoc_act.html. The

trust is generally defined as a property interest held by one person (called the trustee) at the request of another person (called the settlor) for the benefit of a third party (called the beneficiary). Trusts are mostly used in instances where the activities of a nonprofit revolve around the management and distribution of assets. This is because trusts are generally simpler to administer than corporations and have fewer reporting requirements. Nonprofit organizations commonly use trusts in situations where money is collected, invested, or passively managed. For example, scholarship funds and grants for charitable purposes are generally administered through trusts. Employee benefits arrangements, such as tax-qualified retirement plans — 401(k)s — and welfare benefit plans — 419(e)s — also generally use trusts.

Prior to forming your board, it’s a good idea to come up with a profile of the “ideal” board candidate so you know what type of person and skill set you’re searching for. Here are some common considerations:  Personal information: For example, certain backgrounds, ages, cultural and gender qualifications, or financial status may be desirable characteristics for your organization.  Expertise in running organizations: Nonprofit and for-profit organizations don’t differ in their need for effective management — they only differ in their missions. So, it doesn’t matter if your candidate only has experience in one or the other.  Fundraising ability: Funding is the lifeblood of virtually every nonprofit organization, which means that fundraising experience is a must for any candidate

In order to hold a meeting, however, your directors must have a quorum, which is the minimum number of members that must be present to conduct an official meeting. Your organization’s bylaws or other state statutes dictate what constitutes a quorum, but generally it’s a majority. Many bylaws and state statutes allow directors to attend a meeting by telephone or even online.

Although agendas vary in style, most follow a set format. Here’s a common setup: 1. Get the meeting started with a call to order.  2. Approve the minutes from your previous meeting (see the section “Taking minutes” later in the chapter for details on minutes). 3. Give necessary reports (financial reports, for example). 4. Take care of any remaining items that are dictated by the purpose of the meeting, which may include substantive matters, as well as routine issues. 5. Address any old business from prior meetings. 6. Make a call for discussion of any new business. If an item of new business is raised during a meeting and is expected to require more thought and consideration than the time for the meeting will allow, it can be moved to the agenda for an upcoming meeting. 7. Call for adjournment, which officially closes the meeting.

Some of the factors that nonprofits might look at to determine whether other organizations are comparable to theirs for purposes of determining salaries may include the following:  Similar size of budgets: The overall budget of an organization is a good indicator of its complexity to manage and administer.  Organizational revenue: How much revenue an organization generates in the form of donations or earned income is an objective yardstick for comparing organizations.  Number of employees: Arguably, the more people an organization has, the more personnel issues there are to manage. So, higher salaries are justified for those who do the managing.  Similarity of mission: This is a more subjective standard, but it can be useful. For example, if your organization is a preschool, you could compare it to other early childhood programs (as opposed to chambers of commerce or rotary clubs).  Geographic location: Wages differ dramatically by geographical region, and this is a comparative standard that shouldn’t be overlooked. Wages are (and rightfully should be) higher in New York City than in Arkansas, no matter what the position

One way to make sure your organization meets this requirement is to have the compensation committee keep minutes of its meetings. The minutes should include the following items:  Attendees: The minutes should include a list of attendees, their titles or roles, and how they voted on the issues that were discussed.  Consideration of conflicts: Potential conflicts of interest of any members of the compensation committee should be completely aired and fully discussed, and these discussions should be documented in detail.  The date the compensation package was approved: Dates of approval are important because the IRS guidelines require preapproval, not post-approval, of compensation packages.  Due diligence: Minutes should also reflect that the committee took the time and trouble to obtain and review the necessary data about comparable salaries. The comparability data that was obtained and relied on should either be referenced and available for later review, or included with the minutes themselves.  Terms of the compensation package: It’s important to document that all of the costs of the compensation package were considered and specifically approved

Your organization can easily document in writing which perks it intends to include as compensation, and which are reimbursed expenses that don’t count as earnings. A few ways you can do this include the following:  Having a written agreement: Having a signed contract (usually an employment contract) is a simple way to clear up any confusion.  Reporting the item as wages: Let the officer know that it’s compensation by reporting the benefit as compensation on his or her Form W-2.  Using IRS Form 1099: When the person being compensated isn’t considered an employee, but he or she serves the organization in some other capacity (such as an independent contractor or a consultant), the report can be made on a Form 1099 (as opposed to a W-2, which is generally used for employees).  Reporting IRS Form 990: Listing the officers’ compensation on the organization’s annual Form 990 tax return informs the IRS of what the compensation level is.  Telling the officer or employee to report it: Having the officer report the benefit as income on his or her individual income tax return (in cases where it isn’t already listed on a W-2 or 1099) is another way to document how the item is to be treated. Of course, it may be difficult for your organization to know if this has been done, because it isn’t privy to the tax returns of the people working for the organization. Looking

Many nonprofits have volunteer officers who aren’t paid for their services. However, these officers can get reimbursed or receive an allowance for the out-of-pocket expenses that are incurred in connection with their volunteer service. These reimbursements can have tax consequences. For example, if an officer is required to attend a conference to represent the nonprofit, the organization may foot the bill for the trip. Just how an officer’s reimbursement or allowance is paid and accounted for will determine how it will be treated for employment tax purposes. Generally, reimbursement payments to volunteers are made in two ways: accountable plans and non-accountable plans,

An accountable plan is one where all the funds are tracked and business expenses don’t have to be reported on the volunteer’s income tax return. An accountable plan has the following characteristics:  Relationship: There’s a “business” connection between the expense paid and the mission or operations of the organization.  Accounting: The volunteer adequately accounts for the expenses within a reasonable period of time.  Return of funds not used for expenses: Under an accountable plan, a volunteer must return any excess expenses to the organization within a reasonable period of time. If any one of the above three conditions isn’t met, the plan will be considered a non-accountable plan

An organization’s statement may evolve over time, so the board is always busy. A whopping 93 percent of the respondents surveyed in the Johns Hopkins study said that they look to their board of directors to establish the organization’s mission.  Selecting the chief executive and financial officers and deciding how much to pay him or her: A board of directors doesn’t get involved in the day-to-day operations of an organization, but it does hire and fire management, such as the chief executive officer. Eighty-eight percent of the nonprofits surveyed said that they rely on their boards to do this.  Reviewing auditing practices and polices: Many of the nonprofits surveyed said that they had independent audits. Even if these nonprofits didn’t have audits, they indicated that they relied on their boards to evaluate financial data and communicate with accounting professionals.  Approving significant financial transactions: Most of the nonprofits surveyed (81 percent) said that they relied on their boards to review and approve major financial transactions proposed by management.  Establishing the budgets: Most nonprofits leave the budgeting process to the board, probably because this is a function so closely related to achieving the organization’s objectives.

Some of the duties and typical tasks of a board’s directors may include the following:  Defining the mission and long-term goals of the entity: Missions often evolve over time, and an organization is usually evaluated by its success in meeting its mission (as discussed in Chapter 4).  Hiring and firing management and other key employees: Even though board members often serve in a voluntary capacity, and many organizations function primarily using services provided by volunteers, most nonprofits of any size have key managerial employees that must be hired and fired by the board.  Receiving and reviewing reports from management: Board members are usually provided with detailed information that allows them to assess how the organization is doing financially and whether its programs are effectively meeting its mission. The ability of the board to understand and intelligently act as a cohesive group on the information it is receiving is essential to the health of any nonprofit.  Authorizing major projects: Even though boards don’t become embroiled in the day-to-day minutiae of running the organization, they should be fully informed about major projects and program initiatives.  Handling lawsuits and litigation: Ideally, nonprofits avoid becoming involved in lawsuits, litigation, and the threat of such. However, when liability issues rear their ugly head, the board must deal with them.  Managing the media: It’s a basic fact of fundraising that most nonprofit organizations can’t afford a hint of scandal. Negative press can mean negative cash flow. For this reason, boards need to be kept in the loop on public relations issues, and must respond to inquiries and challenges on behalf of the organization

Whistle-blower policies: Because of SOX, boards of nonprofit organizations are required to develop formal procedures for handling complaints about financial misdeeds within the organization. They’re also required to prevent retaliation against those who come forward to report these misdeeds. (Whistle-blower policy requirements are discussed in more detail in Chapter 13.) Under the law, nonprofits are also required to make sure that complaints are investigated. They must document that corrective actions have been taken.  Document retention and destruction policies: SOX requires nonprofit organizations to have written, mandatory document-retention and periodic-destruction policies that include guidelines for electronic files and voicemail. The policies must specify that if official investigation is contemplated, those who destroy documents that are relevant to the investigation will be subject to stringent criminal penalties. If you even suspect any illegal activity, stop the document shredders immediately in order to avoid criminal obstruction.

it’s impractical for most organizations to scrap the dedicated board members they have in favor of independent outsiders who may not understand the delicate balance between the mission, financial constraints, and community image of the organization.

Holding meetings without management being present After SOX, more boards began holding meetings outside of the earshot of management. These boards took this move because excluding the top dogs from meetings enables the boards to more easily evaluate the performance and independence of management. Forming committees for nominating directors Many organizations are adopting specific procedures for recruiting and nominating qualified directors, and they’re also publicly disclosing these policies. Forming compensation committees With all the compensation scandals in both the profit and nonprofit sectors, many boards are adopting compensation committees made up of independent members. These committees help to closely study the issue and make well-considered recommendations. (Flip to Chapter 6 for more details on convening a compensation committee.) Establishing independent audit committees Even though it may be impractical to form an entirely independent board of directors, the board members that sit on the audit committee (discussed in Chapter 10) should be independent. Audit committees deal with the outside accountants and auditors, and they address issues relating to the accuracy of the organization’s financial statement. Making governance guidelines public Similar to the SOX requirements of for-profit corporations, many nonprofit organizations are opting to post their corporate governance guidelines on their Web sites. The following is a checklist of issues that your board may want to address in creating its own guidelines for governing the organization:  Director qualification standards, including procedures for training and continuing education  Responsibilities of directors, including obligations to attend meetings  Policies for director access to management and independent advisors  Procedures for determining director compensation  Management succession policies  A procedure for the board to conduct an annual self-evaluation Evaluating the board’s performance An important component of board self-governance can be the board’s own self-evaluation, which is a mandated exercise for all for-profit corporations subject to SOX. It’s only a best practice for nonprofits. Many boards tackle the self-evaluation requirement by giving board members a questionnaire that asks them to rate how well the board has performed its designated tasks. This approach can have unintended consequences: If the board doesn’t address problems disclosed by negative feedback on a questionnaire, a perception may arise that the board isn’t diligent about fulfilling its responsibility. Thus, the board may feel compelled to follow up on each less-than-perfect rating it receives on the questionnaires.

Special committees: This type of committee (sometimes referred to as an ad hoc committee) is a committee created by the board to resolve or research a specific issue, such as the viability of a new project or the handling of a litigation matter. This type of committee is generally created by board resolution, which means that the board documents (and perhaps votes) that it is taking this action. Examples of special committees would include an executive search committee formed to select and recruit a chief executive officer, or a policy committee formed to write and recommend policies for certain operations (such as branch operations).  Standing committees: These committees are permanent committees that may be provided for in the corporation’s bylaws or board resolutions. The most common example of a standing committee is the audit committee, which functions on an ongoing basis to review and evaluate the organization’s financial matters (see Chapter 10 for more on audit committees). The powers of these committees depend on the bylaws or resolutions that created them. A typical standing committee, for instance, may have considerable power to recommend action to the board or to decide which information is relevant to a board’s decision. For example, a nominating committee may decide which management candidates are actually considered by the board (see the section “Types of Committees” later in the chapter for more on nominating committees). Special committees may also have broad power. One reason a special committee may be formed is to protect the remaining board members from having to assume responsibility or involvement with a particular decision. Occasionally non-board members may be asked to serve on special committees (in a consultant capacity) because they may offer a particular perspective or expertise not found within the composition of board itself.

One specific function of the audit committee is to create a buffer between the people that manage the nonprofit and the auditors and accountants who verify the activities of management. So, most experts agree that the committee should consist entirely of directors who aren’t involved in the management of the nonprofit. Other typical functions of a nonprofit audit committee include the following:  Hiring the audit or accounting firm: The audit committee should make sure that the firm it hires is free of any conflicts. And, if appropriate, the committee needs to confirm that the audit firm isn’t reviewing its own accounting work (which would of course be a conflict of interests).  Reviewing the audit and accounting policies of the organization: Many reporting issues can arise. These issues can affect the accuracy and presentation of the financial statements. It’s the audit committee’s role, then, to thoroughly vet these issues.  Resolving issues that arise between the organization’s management and the auditors: Because part of the auditors’ task is to verify the actions of management and identify the presence of any possible error or fraud, management and auditors should be independent from each other. This means that the board may have to step in to resolve any issues that arise instead of allowing management to negotiate with the auditors (thus compromising the auditors’ independence).  Reviewing the organization’s internal controls: The audit committee must resolve issues relating to the controls within a nonprofit organization. If these types of issues aren’t resolved, the reliability and integrity of the information that appears on its financial statements can be affected.

compensation committees can help bridge the gap. The role of a compensation committee typically includes the following duties:  Researching what similar organizations pay: This research includes identifying similar organizations and positions involving similar skill sets.  Documenting how the committee makes compensation decisions: This documentation is important because if salaries are questioned, the committee needs to be able to explain how it decided on the salary it ultimately awarded.  Awarding raises: Typically compensation committees are charged with evaluating staff, documenting the results of performance reviews, and deciding the level of raises and bonuses to award.

Equity credits can be converted to cash by the cooperative on a set basis, or at the general discretion of the cooperative’s board of directors when the financial health of the cooperative justifies a redemption. Many cooperatives have an equity redemption or rotation plan in place so that each member knows when to expect to receive cash for the full value of the accumulated equity certificates.

Related versus unrelated business income: After a distinction is made between earned and unearned income, the IRS makes a further distinction between income that’s earned from activities and products related to the organization’s tax-exempt purpose, and profit-making activities that bear no relationship to the organization’s purpose for being.

Nonprofits aren’t allowed to compete with private businesses on a tax-free basis because doing so would give them a grossly unfair competitive advantage. If your nonprofit engages in a business venture that’s unrelated to its purpose (like operating a pizza parlor when its mission is to help fund medical research projects), the profits from that venture are taxable. However, if the organization as a whole has too much taxable income, it may lose its tax-exempt status altogether. For this reason, successful nonprofit groups, such as the National Geographic Society, have had to spin off business projects that became too profitable.

Alternately, if a group develops a decision-making method that is totally original and alien to their society, they may face challenges including newcomers and explaining their method to outsiders — this is sometimes a weakness of infoshops in the US, which employ a well thought-out, idealized form of decision-making complex enough to seem foreign even to many participants.

If anything, getting paid to do something makes it less enjoyable. The alienation of labor that is a part of capitalism destroys natural incentives to work such as the pleasure of acting freely and the satisfaction of a job well done. When work puts us in a position of inferiority — to the boss who oversees us and the wealthy people who own our workplace — and we do not have decision-making power in our job but must mindlessly follow orders, it can become excruciatingly odious and mind-numbing. We also lose our natural incentive to work when we are not doing something that is useful for our communities. Of the few workers today who are lucky enough to actually produce something they can see, they are nearly all making something that is profitable to their employers but completely meaningless to them personally.

For example, after decades of sticking by their egalitarian founding principles regarding pay scales, eventually the Mondragón cooperatives decided to increase the salaries of the managerial and technical experts relative to the manual workers. Their reason was that they had a hard time retaining people who could receive much higher pay for their skills in a corporation. This problem indicates a need to mix manual and intellectual tasks to avoid the professionalization of expertise (i.e. creating expertise as a quality restricted to an elite few); and to build an economy in which people are producing not for profit but for other members of the network, so money loses its importance and people work out of a sense of community and solidarity.

Anarchists theorize that the problems of capitalism do not exist only in the relationship between workers and owners, but also between workers and managers, and that as long as the manager-worker relationship persists, capitalism can reemerge. This theory is certainly born out by the Mondragón example, where over time managers gained more pay and power and renewed the unequal, profit-focused dynamics typical of capitalism.

the methods of Paulo Freire, who developed the “pedagogy of the oppressed.” In São Paulo the MST has built itself an autonomous university which trains farmers nominated by the individual settlements. Rather than teaching, for example, agribusiness, as a capitalist university would, they teach family agriculture with a critique of the exploitative and environmentally destructive techniques prevalent in contemporary agriculture. For other technical courses the MST also helps people get educations in public universities, though they often win the collaboration of leftwing professors to offer more critical lessons of a higher caliber, even enabling them to design their own courses. They emphasize in all these forms of education that it is the responsibility of the students to use what they learn for their community and not for individual profit. The Movimiento Campesino de Santiago de Estero, MOCASE, is a group of farmers, many of them Quechua, with similarities and connections to the MST. Beginning as a group of farmers fighting for land in the face of expansion by forestry companies from the Global North, they now number 8,000 families in 58 communities active in a broad range of struggles. Working together with the Universidad Transhumante, they set up a Farmers School that helps farmers learn the skills necessary for self-management. The students also learn to teach, so they can help train other farmers.

Outside of the control of the state, education need not be a static, fixed thing. It can be a tool of empowerment, as people are taught how to teach, so they can pass on the lessons they learn rather than being permanently dependent on a class of professional educators. It can be a tool of liberation, as people learn about authority and resistance, and study how to take control over their own lives. It can be a caravan, a circus, as people travel across a country and instead of bringing caged spectacles they bring new ideas and techniques. And it can be a tool for survival, as oppressed peoples learn about their histories and prepare for their futures.

One inspiring example of an informal city is El Alto, Bolivia. El Alto sits on the Altiplano, the plateau overlooking La Paz, the capital. A few decades ago El Alto was just a small town, but as global economic changes caused the shutting down of mines and small farms, huge numbers of people came here. Unable to reside in La Paz, they built settlements up on the plateau, changing the town into a major urban area with 850,000 residents. Seventy percent of the people who have jobs here make their living through family businesses in an informal economy. Land use is unregulated, and the state provides little or no infrastructure: most neighborhoods do not have paved roads, garbage removal services, or indoor plumbing, 75% of the population lacks basic health care, and 40% are illiterate. Faced with this situation, the residents of the informal city took their self-organization to the next step, by creating neighborhood councils, or juntas. The first juntas in El Alto go back to the ‘50s. In 1979 these juntas started to coordinate through a new organization, the Federation of Neighborhood Councils, FEJUVE. Now there are nearly 600 juntas in El Alto. The juntas allow neighbors to pool resources to create and maintain necessary infrastructure, like schools, parks, and basic utilities. They also mediate disputes and levy sanctions in cases of conflict and social harm. The federation, FEJUVE, pools the resources of the juntas to coordinate protests and blockades and constitute the slum dwellers as a social force. In just the first five years of the new millennium, FEJUVE took a lead role in establishing a public university in El Alto, blocking new municipal taxes, and deprivatizing the water services. FEJUVE also was instrumental in the popular movement that forced the government to nationalize the natural gas resources. Each junta typically contains at least 200 people and meets every month, making general decisions through public discussion and consensus. They also elect a committee which meets more frequently and has an administrative role. Political party leaders, merchants, real estate speculators, and those who collaborated with the dictatorship are not allowed to be committee delegates. More men than women sit on these committees; however a greater percentage of women take on leadership roles in FEJUVE than in other Bolivian popular organizations. Parallel to the organization in neighborhood councils is the organization of infrastructure and economic activity in unions or syndicates. The street vendors and transportation workers, for example, self-organize in their own base unions. Both the neighborhood councils and their counterparts in the informal economy are patterned after the traditional communitarian organization of rural indigenous communities (ayllu) in terms of territoriality, structure and organizational principles.

One inspiring example of an informal city is El Alto, Bolivia. El Alto sits on the Altiplano, the plateau overlooking La Paz, the capital. A few decades ago El Alto was just a small town, but as global economic changes caused the shutting down of mines and small farms, huge numbers of people came here. Unable to reside in La Paz, they built settlements up on the plateau, changing the town into a major urban area with 850,000 residents. Seventy percent of the people who have jobs here make their living through family businesses in an informal economy. Land use is unregulated, and the state provides little or no infrastructure: most neighborhoods do not have paved roads, garbage removal services, or indoor plumbing, 75% of the population lacks basic health care, and 40% are illiterate. Faced with this situation, the residents of the informal city took their self-organization to the next step, by creating neighborhood councils, or juntas. The first juntas in El Alto go back to the ‘50s. In 1979 these juntas started to coordinate through a new organization, the Federation of Neighborhood Councils, FEJUVE. Now there are nearly 600 juntas in El Alto. The juntas allow neighbors to pool resources to create and maintain necessary infrastructure, like schools, parks, and basic utilities. They also mediate disputes and levy sanctions in cases of conflict and social harm. The federation, FEJUVE, pools the resources of the juntas to coordinate protests and blockades and constitute the slum dwellers as a social force. In just the first five years of the new millennium, FEJUVE took a lead role in establishing a public university in El Alto, blocking new municipal taxes, and deprivatizing the water services. FEJUVE also was instrumental in the popular movement that forced the government to nationalize the natural gas resources. Each junta typically contains at least 200 people and meets every month, making general decisions through public discussion and consensus. They also elect a committee which meets more frequently and has an administrative role. Political party leaders, merchants, real estate speculators, and those who collaborated with the dictatorship are not allowed to be committee delegates. More men than women sit on these committees; however a greater percentage of women take on leadership roles in FEJUVE than in other Bolivian popular organizations. Parallel to the organization in neighborhood councils is the organization of infrastructure and economic activity in unions or syndicates. The street vendors and transportation workers, for example, self-organize in their own base unions. Both the neighborhood councils and their counterparts in the informal economy are patterned after the traditional communitarian organization of rural indigenous communities (ayllu) in terms of territoriality, structure and organizational principles. They also reflect the traditions of radical miners’ unions, which for decades led Bolivia’s militant labor movement. Fusing these experiences, El Alto’s migrants have reproduced, transplanted and adapted their communities of origin to facilitate survival in a hostile urban environment. [...]Through the neighborhood juntas, El Alto has developed as a self-constructed city run by a network of micro-governments independent of the state. In Raúl Zibechi’s view, the autonomous organization of labor in the informal sector, based on productivity and family ties instead of the hierarchical boss-worker relationship, reinforces this sense of empowerment: Citizens can self-manage and control their own environment

How would densely populated cities feed themselves without subjugating or exploiting the surrounding countryside? It may be that the subjugation of rural areas by cities played a role in the emergence of the state thousands of years ago. But cities do not have to be as unsustainable as they are now. The 19th century anarchist Peter Kropotkin wrote about a phenomenon that suggested interesting possibilities for anarchist cities. Urban gardeners in and immediately around Paris supplied most of the city’s vegetables via intensive agriculture supported by plentiful manure from the city, as well as industrial products, such as glass for greenhouses, that was too costly for farmers in rural areas. These suburban gardeners lived close enough to the city that they could come in every week to sell their produce at market. The spontaneous development of this system of gardening was one of Kropotkin’s inspirations in writing about anarchist cities.

But in the regime of libertarian solidarity, these difficulties were overcome by the efforts of the whole district.

Anarchism is one of the few revolutionary ideas that does not require modernization; anarchist societies are free to organize themselves at any sustainable level of technology. This means that societies currently existing as hunter-gatherers, or groups of people who choose to adopt such a lifestyle, can practice this most efficient and ecological form of subsistence, the most conducive to a resilient ecosystem that is less vulnerable to natural disasters.

Competition may seem to be a useful principle for encouraging efficiency — but efficiency for what purpose? Beneath the mythology it has created, capitalism is not actually a competitive system. Workers are divided and played against each other, while the elite cooperate to maintain their subjection. The wealthy may compete for bigger slices of the pie, but they regularly take up arms together to ensure that every day the pie is baked and brought to their table.

Power and alienation must be pursued to their roots. It is not enough for the workers to own their factories collectively if they are controlled by managers and the work still reduces them to machines. Alienation is not simply the absence of legal ownership of the means and fruits of production — it is the lack of control over one’s relationship with the world. Worker ownership of a factory is meaningless if it is still administered by others on their behalf. The workers must organize themselves and control the factory directly. And even if they control the factory directly, alienation persists where the broader economic relationships, the factory itself, dictates the form their labor takes. Can a person truly be free working on an assembly line, denied creativity and treated as a machine? The form of work itself must change, so that people can pursue the skills and activities that give them joy.

Money exerts such a powerful influence on notions of value that consumption itself is always anticlimactic: once the commodity is purchased, it loses its value, especially as people come to prioritize abstract value over subjective value. Furthermore, having purchased it, you lose money, and your total holdings of symbolic value decrease — hence the nagging feeling of guilt that accompanies spending money.

Earthhaven, with about 60 residents, was founded in 1995 in North Carolina by permaculture designers. It is composed of several neighborhood clusters set in the steep Appalachian hills. Most of the land is covered in forest, but the residents recently made the difficult decision to clear some of the forest for gardens so they could come closer to food self-sufficiency rather than exporting the costs of their lifestyle by purchasing food from elsewhere. They talked about it a long time, prepared themselves spiritually, and attempted to clear the land in a respectful way. This sort of attitude, which capitalist ideology would dismiss as sentimental and inefficient, is exactly what could prevent destruction of the environment in an anarchist society.

Companies are allowed to make millions of tons of plastic, most of it for throwaway packaging, despite the fact that they have no plan for disposing of it and not even any idea what will happen with it all; plastic does not decompose, so plastic trash is filling up the ocean and appearing in the bodies of marine creatures, and it may last millions of years.

the so-called tragedy of the commons. This myth is often explained thus: imagine a society of sheepherders owns the grazing land in common. They benefit collectively if each grazes a smaller number of sheep, because the pasture stays fertile, but any one of them benefits individually if he overgrazes, because he will receive a greater share of the product — thus collective ownership supposedly leads to depletion of resources. The historical examples intended to corroborate this theory are generally drawn from colonial and postcolonial situations in which oppressed people, whose traditional forms of organization and stewardship have been undermined, are crowded onto marginal land, with predictable results. The sheepherding scenario assumes a situation that is extremely rare in human history: a collective comprised of atomized, competitive individuals who value personal wealth over social bonds and ecological health, and lack social arrangements or traditions that can guarantee sustainable, shared use.

In an empowered society, people do not need written laws; they have the power to determine whether someone is preventing them from fulfilling their needs, and can call on their peers for help resolving conflicts. In this view, the problem is not crime, but social harm — actions such as assault and drunk driving that actually hurt other people. This paradigm does away with the category of victimless crime, and reveals the absurdity of protecting the property rights of privileged people over the survival needs of others. The outrages typical of capitalist justice, such as arresting the hungry for stealing from the wealthy, would not be possible in a needs-based paradigm.

Some of the most uncompromising struggles against the state are indigenist. Current indigenist struggles have created some of the only zones in North America that enjoy physical and cultural autonomy and have successfully defended themselves in periodic confrontations with the state. These struggles typically do not identify themselves as anarchist, and perhaps for this reason anarchists have even more to learn from them. But if learning is not to be another commodity relation, an act of acquisition, it must be accompanied by horizontal relationships of reciprocity, which is to say, solidarity. The Mohawk nation have long fought against colonization and in 1990 they won a major victory against the forces of the settler state. In Kanehsatake territory, near Montreal, white people in the town of Oka wanted to expand a golf course at the expense of a forested area in which a Mohawk graveyard was located, sparking native protests. In the spring of 1990, Mohawks set up a camp there and blocked the road. On July 11, 1990, Quebec police attacked the encampment with tear gas and automatic weapons, but the Mohawk defenders were armed and dug in. One cop was shot and killed and the rest ran away. The police cars, which they had left behind in panic, were used to build new barricades. Meanwhile, Mohawk warriors at Kahnawake blocked Mercier Bridge, halting commuter traffic to Montreal. Police began a seige of the Mohawk communities, but more warriors came, smuggling in supplies. The resisters organized food, medical care, and communications services, and the blockades persisted. White mobs formed in neighborhing towns and rioted, demanding police violence to open the bridge and restore traffic. Later in August, these mobs attacked a group of Mohawks while police stood by. On August 20, the blockades were still going strong, and the Canadian military took over the siege from the police. In total 4,500 troops were deployed, backed by tanks, armored personnel carriers, helicopters, fighter jets, artillery, and naval ships. On September 18, Canadian soldiers raided Tekakwitha Island, shooting tear gas and bullets. The Mohawks fought back and the soldiers had to be evacuated by helicopter. Across Canada, native people protested in solidarity with the Mohawk, occupying buildings, blocking railroads and highways, and carrying out acts of sabotage. Unknown people burned down railway bridges in British Colombia and Alberta, and cut down five hydro-electric towers in Ontario. On September 26, the remaining besieged Mohawk declared victory and walked out, having burned their weapons. The golf course was never expanded, and most of those arrested were acquitted of weapons and riot charges. “Oka served to revitalize the warrior spirit of indigenous peoples and our will to resist.”

Because of the globally integrated nature of the system, states and other institutions of power are mutually reinforcing, and thus stronger up to a certain point. But beyond that point, they are all weaker, and vulnerable to collapse on a global scale like never before in history. Political crisis in China could destroy the US economy, and send other dominoes falling as well. We have not yet reached the point at which we can overthrow the global power structure, but it is significant that in specific contests the state is often unable to crush us, and bubbles of autonomy exist alongside the system that purports to be universal and without alternatives. Governments are overthrown every year. The system has still not been abolished because the victors of such struggles have always been co-opted and reincorporated into global capitalism. But if explicitly anti-authoritarian movements can take the initiative in popular resistance, this is a hopeful sign for the future.

In the following years, the weakening of the movement’s anti-authoritarian character has demonstrated a major obstacle to libertarian insurrections that win a bubble of autonomy: not an inevitable, creeping authoritarianism, but constant international pressure on the movement to institutionalize. In Kabylia, much of that pressure came from European NGOs and international agencies who claimed to work for peace. They demanded that the aarch coordinations adopt peaceful tactics, give up their boycott of politics, and field candidates for election. Since then, the movement has split. Many aarch delegates and elders who appointed themselves leaders have entered the political arena, where their main objective is to rewrite the Algerian constitution to institute democratic reforms and end the present dictatorship. Meanwhile, the Movement for Autonomy in Kabylia (MAK) has continued to insist that power should be decentralized and the region should win independence.

An ideology or analysis that was revolutionary as well as anti-authoritarian might have prevented recuperation and facilitated solidarity with movements in other countries. At the same time, movements in other countries might have been positioned to give solidarity had they developed a broader understanding of struggle. For example, due to a host of historical and cultural reasons it is not at all likely that the insurrection in Algeria would ever have identified itself as “anarchist,” yet it was one of the most inspiring examples of anarchy to appear in those years. Most self-identified anarchists were prevented from realizing this and initiating relationships of solidarity due to a cultural bias against struggles that do not adopt the aesthetics and cultural inheritance prevalent among Euro/American revolutionaries.

There had been a long-running debate in anarchist circles about whether fighting capitalism as a system necessitated attacking specific individuals in power, apart from situations of self-defense. The fact that those in power, when shown mercy, turned right around and gave names to the firing squads to punish the rebels and discourage future uprisings underscored the argument that elites are not just innocently playing a role within an impersonal system, but that they specifically involve themselves in waging war against the oppressed. Thus, the killings carried out by the Spanish anarchists and peasants were not signs of an authoritarianism inherent in revolutionary struggle so much as an intentional strategy within a dangerous conflict. The contemporaneous behavior of the Stalinists, who established a secret police force to torture and execute their erstwhile comrades, demonstrates how low people can sink when they think they’re fighting for a just cause; but the contrasting example offered by anarchists and other socialists proves that such behavior is not inevitable.

The problem came from the CNT delegates. The union had failed to structure itself in a way that prevented its becoming institutionalized. Delegates to the Regional and National Committees could not be recalled if they failed to perform as desired, there was no custom to prevent the same people from maintaining constant positions on these higher committees, and negotiations or decisions made by higher committees did not always have to be ratified by the entire membership. Furthermore, principled anarchist militants consistently refused the top positions in the Confederation, while intellectuals focused on abstract theories and economic planning gravitated to these central committees.

One of the chief reasons the CNT leadership gave for collaborating with the authoritarian parties was that abolishing the government in Catalunya would be tantamount to imposing an anarchist dictatorship. But their assumption that getting rid of the government — or, more accurately, allowing a spontaneous popular movement to do so — meant replacing it with the CNT showed their own blinding self-importance. They failed to grasp that the working class was developing new organizational forms, such as factory councils, that might flourish best by transcending pre-existing institutions — whether the CNT or the government — rather than being absorbed into them. The CNT leadership “failed to realise how powerful the popular movement was and that their role as union spokesmen was now inimical to the course of the revolution.” Rather than painting a rosy picture of history, we should recognize that these examples show that navigating the tension between effectiveness and authoritarianism is not easy, but it is possible.

An essential part of an anarchist revolution is global solidarity. Solidarity is the polar opposite of charity. It does not depend on an inequality between giver and receiver. Like all good things in life, solidarity is shared, thus it destroys the categories of giver and receiver and neither ignores nor validates whatever unequal power dynamics may exist between the two. There can be no true solidarity between a revolutionary in Illinois and a revolutionary in Mato Grosso if they must ignore that the one’s house is built with wood stolen from the lands of the other, ruining the soil and leaving him and his entire community with fewer possibilities for the future.

Throughout the 2006 rebellion in Oaxaca, as well as before and after, indigenous culture was a wellspring of resistance. However much they exemplified cooperative, anti-authoritarian, and ecologically sustainable behaviors before colonialism, indigenous peoples in the Oaxacan resistance came to cherish and emphasize the parts of their culture that contrasted with the system that values property over life, encourages competition and domination, and exploits the environment into extinction. Their ability to practice an anti-authoritarian and ecological culture — working together in a spirit of solidarity and nourishing themselves on the small amount of land they had — increased the potency of their resistance, and thus their very chances for survival. Thus, resistance to capitalism and the state is both a means of protecting indigenous cultures and a crucible that forges a stronger anti-authoritarian ethos. Many of the people who participated in the rebellion were not themselves indigenous, but they were influenced and inspired by indigenous culture. Thus, the act of rebellion itself allowed people to choose social values and shape their own identities.

Another of the villages around Itoiz, Aritzkuren, exemplifies a certain aesthetic that represents another idea of history. Thirteen years ago, a handful of people occupied the village, which had been abandoned for over fifty years before that. Since then, they have constructed all their dwellings within the ruins of the old hamlet. Half of Aritzkuren is still ruins, slowly decomposing into forest on a mountainside an hour’s drive from the nearest paved road. The ruins are a reminder of the origin and foundation of the living parts of the village, and they serve as storage spaces for building materials that will be used to renovate the rest of it. The new sense of history that lives amidst these piled stones is neither linear nor amnesiac, but organic — in that the past is the shell of the present and compost of the future. It is also post-capitalist, suggesting a return to the land and the creation of a new society in the ruins of the old.

At Aritzkuren as at other autonomous villages throughout the world, life is both laborious and relaxed. The residents must build all their infrastructure themselves and create most of the things they need with their own hands, so there is plenty of work to do. People get up in the morning and work on their own projects, or else everyone comes together for a collective effort decided on at a previous meeting. Following a huge lunch which one person cooks for everyone on a rotating basis, people have the whole afternoon to relax, read, go into town, work in the garden, or fix up a building. Some days, nobody works at all; if one person decides to skip a day, there are no recriminations, because there are meetings at which to make sure responsibilities are evenly distributed. In this context, characterized by a close connection to nature, inviolable individual freedom mixed with a collective social life, and the blurring of work and pleasure, the people of Aritzkuren have created not only a new lifestyle, but an ethos compatible with living in an anarchist society.

Despite their physical isolation, these villages are very much involved in the outside world and in social movements struggling to change it. The residents share their experiences in creating sustainable collectives with other anarchist and autonomous collectives throughout the country. Many people divide each year between the village and the city, balancing a more utopian existence with participation in ongoing struggles. The villages also serve as a refuge for activists taking a break from stressful city life. Many of the villages carry on projects that keep them involved in social struggles; for example, one autonomous village in Italy provides a peaceful setting for a group that translates radical texts. Likewise, the villages around Itoiz have been a major part of the twenty-year-running resistance to the hydroelectric dam there.

A new ethos can come about in the process of resisting, as we find common cause with strangers and discover our own powers. It can also be nourished by the environments we build for ourselves. A truly liberating ethos is not just a new set of values, but a new approach to the relationship between the individual and her culture; it requires that people shift from being passive recipients of culture to participants in its creation and reinterpretation.

But societies that do not want to war with their neighbors can structure themselves to prevent it. Not having borders is an important first step. Often we can arrive at the truth by simply reversing the rationalizations of the state, and the line about borders keeping us safe can easily be decoded: borders endanger us. If there is a social conflict, violence is much more likely to break out if there is an “us” and a “them.” Clear social divisions and borders prevent reconciliation and mutual understanding and encourage competition and polarization.

Anarchist societies encourage the free creation of overlapping networks between neighbors, communities, and societies. These networks may include material exchange, cultural communication, friendships, family relationships, and solidarity. There is no clear delineation of where one society ends and another begins, or what the sides would be in a conflict. When there is a feud, the feuding parties are likely to have many social relationships in common, and many third parties will be caught in the middle. In a culture that emphasizes competition and conquest, they may still take sides and offset the possibility of reconciliation. But if their culture values cooperation, consensus, and social connectedness, and their economic relationships reinforce these values, they are more likely to encourage mediation and peace between the feuding parties. They might do so out of a personal desire for peace, because of a concern for the well-being of the people involved in the fight, or out of self-interest, as they also depend on the health of the social networks in question. In such a society, self-interest, community interests, and ideals enjoy a greater confluence than in our own society.

It seems that states developed gradually out of culturally accepted kinship systems that coupled gerontocracy with patriarchy — over a period of generations, older men were accorded more respect and given greater exclusivity as the mediators of disputes and the dispensers of gifts. Not until very late in this process did they possess anything resembling a power to enforce their will. We must remember that as people gradually surrendered more of their responsibilities and afforded certain members of the community more respect, they had no way of knowing the outcomes of their actions — no way of knowing just how bad hierarchical society could become.

The majority of societies throughout human history have been communal and stateless, and many of them lasted for millennia until they were destroyed or conquered by Western civilization. The growth and power of Western civilization were not inevitable but rather the result of specific historic processes arguably dependent on geographic coincidence. The military successes of our civilization might seem to prove its superiority, but even in the absence of resistance, problems endemic to our civilization such as deforestation and climate change may well bring about its demise, revealing it to be an utter failure in terms of sustainability.

one of the many errors of the state is the neurotic supposition that society is perfectible, that it is possible to craft blueprints that provide for all problems before they occur. Favoring laws over case-by-case evaluation and common sense, maintaining a standing army, granting the police emergency powers on a permanent basis — all these stem from the paranoia of statism.

Then Boulay takes the subtext from just below the surface and hauls it up on deck. He tells Donna that she’s just a small-town girl, that she belongs here, and that business is business. It is one of the strengths of the screenplay that if ever there’s a chance of thematic ambiguity, someone will verbally intervene and, bluntly, restate the theme. The phrase ‘business is business’ will haunt us later. It’s a phrase that’s hard to refute, much like the phrase ‘genocide is genocide’, but the trauma of this rejection will lead Donna to harden up and focus on her own ‘business’. Business that will take her far away from Silver Springs, business that will take her to business class and beyond.

People you haven’t met are easy to idealise, but people who don’t exist are even better. Once you’ve met someone you’re faced with both the uncomfortable realisation that they’re a person and the exhausting prospect of paying attention to what might be unique about them. Invented idols can be controlled. What happens when we’ve long admired someone for their talent and then find out that despite the fact they excel at darts, they’re socially conservative? How can we go on enjoying the way a person throws miniature arrows at some circular cork now that we diverge politically? And what if we find that people who make art can be terrible, perhaps even criminal? How do we get back the time we wasted enjoying their work before we knew that we wouldn’t have enjoyed it if we’d known? Can we not get some kind of certification of sanctity before we allow ourselves to be moved? Because to be moved by something made by someone who has done something bad would mean that a bad person possesses the capacity to connect to us; that they haven’t, somehow, forfeited their humanity. So we must be on guard against gurus, lest their imperfections infect.

In this respect, romantic comedies have much less moral integrity than violent action films. The vigilante remains an outsider. He is not rewarded. He remains poor, unmoored, lonely. Contrast that with the couple, whose highest priority is each other. How are they meant to stop the Kurdish terrorist from releasing the nerve gas? They’d be too busy staring into each other’s eyes to notice; and if they did notice, how would they form a coherent plan under pressure, while respecting each other’s equally valuable personhood? The only dilemma in the romantic comedy is: what keeps the couple apart? Once they’re together, that’s the end of anything interesting that could be said about them. It’s a quick fade to black and then on with their inward-facing existence. Two people whose highest priority is each other is not a monetisable prospect; nor does conscientious mutual consideration make for movie magic. In the romantic comedy, a man, let’s call him Brad, neglects his family for his career, with the inevitable estrangement that follows, only to realise, late in the third act, that his family comes before everything. At this point, Brad will reject his work, refuse to give the Big Presentation to Yamamoto Corp. and run like hell to Bobby’s piano recital, and when he arrives he’ll cheer louder than all the stiffs who wasted their time attending previous school events, because this school event is actually the important one and makes up for all the other (historic) absences, so who cares if his suit is sweat-sodden and he paid $20,000 for a seat on the last plane back from Denver, because when Brad hugs his child, who played piano better than he ever thought possible because his awesome dad showed up for him, a seemingly innocuous remark from a bystander triggers one of Brad’s madcap ideas. And they all run – as a family – into the patrician office of Brad’s Boss, disrupting its froideur, and Brad outlines an idea of such brilliance that the secretaries who’ve been there since Brad was a trainee stand up and start applauding – and Brad’s Boss gets a faraway look in his eye – like this might work – perhaps this is the very thing our business needs to survive in the modern competitive landscape – even though his yuppie son Bobby says, ‘Brad’s crazy – Brad’s always been crazy – it’ll never work – don’t tell me you like this crazy idea’ – to which Brad’s Boss says, ‘What do you know? – You’ve had a silver spoon up your ass for so long it’s scooped out your brains – and Bobby looks shocked because an adult said something about a spoon going up someone’s ass – but it’s okay – it’s just salty talk – in fact, it shows healthy non-conformity – and Brad’s Boss looks at young Bobby and says, ‘You know what, son? I had a crazy idea once: it was about setting up a company that takes risks. And that company put us on the map, only now I think we’ve lost our way, and maybe that’s because we’ve forgotten how to be crazy. And sure, maybe your dad is kinda crazy, but if Brad’s crazy, so am I. We could all use a little crazy right now’ – and then Brad’s Boss looks up at Brad and asks, ‘Will you come back and maybe run the company for me? I think it’s time I took the silver spoon out of my own ass and used it to make a little hay while the sun’s still shining’ – and now Brad and his wife are hugging and bringing Bobby in close – so close – they’ve never been this close – or rich – they’re richer than ever – but truer too – and they’ll never forget what’s important – and although it may look like they’re having their cake and eating it – for some reason it’s different from having your cake and eating it – it’s more like working out how to manufacture cake on such a scale that you couldn’t eat it all if you tried. But people who make films that tell us to prioritise family over work still expect us to pay to see their films. If I were to try to see one of their exhortations at the cinema, but found myself impecunious, could I, as a lover of romantic comedies, appeal to the good heart of the usher? AYOADE: Don’t you see? I know I don’t have any money to pay for a ticket. That’s because I spend so much time playing with my children and being present to those I love. I’ve been fired from every job I ever had, but my school-concert attendance record is second to none. They actually wondered whether I was a talent scout, but I said, ‘No. I’m not a talent scout. I was a talent scout, but they kept wanting me to scout talent instead of impulsively fly kites with my children and giddily run through meadows and show up at my wife’s work (she’s a surgeon) and say, “Come with me now, I miss you. What’s more important, this emergency appendectomy you’re performing or taking time out for cupcakes and waffles?”’ I’ve followed the making of [insert name of film] for a long time. I managed to read the script of [insert name of film] in advance – you see, I used to be an actor for a while – I was actually asked to read for a part in [insert name of film], but I’d promised my niece I’d play Poohsticks with her whenever she wanted, and she said she wanted to play Poohsticks at the same time as the audition, and she lives in Peckham, so it involved taking a train out to the country to find a stream that was magical enough. So I was – big deal – three or four days late for the audition. But those precious moments trudging through the pissing rain trying to find a stream that precisely conformed to a half-remembered line drawing of a stream from a book that I forgot to bring in the heady rush of it all … well, those are moments you never get back.

Anyway, I was so impressed with the script of [insert name of film] and its message of family first that I thought I’d visit the set and tell the director how proud I was that he would devote so much of his time and effort to it, and that even though I wouldn’t get to play a part in [insert name of film] because of my own family commitments, I was just so glad, as a cinema fan, that it was going to be made. So I went to the set, but I was told I couldn’t see the director and that I had ‘no right to be there’. So I said, ‘Fine. I’ll wait.’ And they said, ‘Well, we can’t stop you.’ And I said, ‘That’s right. You can’t stop me.’ And then, later, I said, ‘Because you don’t own the road, do you?’ Which was both true and something I hadn’t thought of straight away. In fact, there was a big enough gap between the two statements that I had to remind the guard what I was originally talking about. I waited until the director was finished for the day, which was very late, and I was sad because I actually missed dinner with my family. I was about to check into a Travelodge when I saw the director leaving the studio, so I ran up to him and said, ‘I just want to say thank you for making this film about how important family is, because it’s very important to me.’ And he said, ‘Who are you?’ And I said, ‘A family man.’ And he said that being a family man was the best thing you could be, and that he had a family himself. ‘I expect you’ll be going home to see them now,’ I said. He said that he wished he were, but they lived in America. He had two daughters. (His wife had been accidentally decapitated at a theme park, but now they had a really good live-in au pair.) I said, ‘Why don’t they come over to be with you?’ He said that he works such long hours that he wouldn’t get to see them anyway, and that even though it was hard for him to be away all this time because he’s such a committed family man, they all decided it was best if they stayed in America with the au pair – he couldn’t stress enough how good this au pair was – but he would get to see them in five weeks’ time. I said, ‘Why don’t they come to the set? They could shout out ideas and create a nice atmosphere for everyone.’ He said, ‘It’s a nice thought, but I need to concentrate, and I don’t know that I could do that with them around.’ I said, ‘So you would rather they weren’t here?’ There was a pause. He seemed tense for some reason. So I decided to ask another question to relax him. ‘What scene were you shooting today?’ I asked. ‘The scene where the hero’s wife says that if he can’t make it to their son’s softball final, he needn’t bother coming back.’ ‘I like that scene,’ I said. ‘So do I,’ he said. We both bowed our heads a little. ‘Are you going to be here all night?’ interrupted the guard. ‘Some of us have got homes to go to!’ ‘We’re talking about the importance of family, asshole,’ I explained. The guard said something about not having seen his kids for two weeks now because he’d been working so late, and I said he should be grateful for the overtime and that there were plenty of people who would kill for his job. The guard said, ‘Don’t you see the irony?’ I said that I didn’t. And that if there were any irony about the place, I would have seen it because I’m an artist, and that’s what I’m trained to do. I said that the director and I were creative people, and that we had a different ontology to him. ‘Our needs are non-commensurate with yours, Marcellus …’ I added. ‘Don’t proof-quote Alain Badiou to me,’ said the guard. ‘I haven’t got the time.’ We looked at each other. We saw one another. We, finally, understood one another. We all laughed and held each other close. I’d never felt as close to anyone as to those two men. All three of us, desperate to get back to our families, but instead deciding to go out for ribs, and talk about the breakthrough we’d made, and also to drink beer. Somehow we all lost our phones so we couldn’t get Ubers, and I decided to walk because it wasn’t that far, but I realised it was at least fifty miles till I would be outside my front door. And then I thought, ‘I wish we could get an au pair. I’m a hostage in my own home.’ The usher looked at me. I could tell my story had moved her. She now knew there was more to this world than the mere material. That something as tawdry and gross as money would be a Badiou-like barrier to our two souls touching in a subconscious fist-bump of empathy and understanding. But by that time the film was nearly over. I think that’s why she told me to leave. Emergency Landing Donna figuratively and literally flies to Ted’s family home.

Ines’ voice was a buzz in my headpiece. “Those who declare their surprise at the rebirth of Antonio Vivaldi reveal their ignorance of the composer’s history, in particular his former ‘rebirth’, in the sense of the rediscovery of his works.” I knew the sentence by heart. It had been part of our initial tender. The question was why she felt the need to speak these words so long after our mission had been approved, now that we were actually setting off. Who was she trying to convince? Herself? The thought was shocking. I watched as she descended ahead of me—Ines Abbracciabene PPS., D.Mus. (Hons), GcS, weighed down by the letters after her name. If she no longer believed, I decided, I would believe for her. The ‘anomalous sounds’ were first recorded by hydrophone array a year before—a dozen notes, sometimes longer, once an entire passage. There were those who denied it was music at all: it was crustal settling, whale vocalisations and so on . . . not explanations anyone actually believed, but place-markers for when the real explanation came along—something natural, something unsurprising . . . Then there were those who accepted the truth, but quarrelled over provenance: the music was attributable to an emergent property of the new architectures, or to the creature they were pleased to call ‘Revivaldi’, or even to Vivaldi reborn . . . These considerations were unimportant. Whatever the source, it was music, his music. It was part of the canon. * * *   The Adriatic had been a single colossal roar, the waves’ upper reaches, ten and fifteen storeys high, flagged white in surrender to the living winds—draught animals, panicked and rolling-eyed, cruelly thrashed by the unremitting El Niño: ‘little boy’ no longer, but a wildman, unpredictable, ‘acting out’. But down here . . . down here it was quiet. La Serenissima . . . Our descent continued, Ines a dim shape before me, sliding down the clewline, her exhaled bubbles streaming into my faceplate so that I missed the moment when we entered the city. “Ah!” Her exclamations were a buzz in my ears. “Here! Anne! Do you see?” The bubbles cleared. My first glimpse of Venice was of a parking garage. * * *   The maps identified it as the Yellow Gate ParkRite, in the Piazzale Roma. The guiding philosophy of the chief architects, Elwert+Ippolito Gruppen, was clearly evident here. Remove its function and even a parking lot becomes art. Much of the structure was gone in favour of radiolarian-glass, bluegreen helices winding around the interior to represent the paths once described by automobiles, constellated with stars suggesting the three- and four-point turns with which they’d negotiated their parking spaces. Microtubules, micro no more, pulsed in mock of the old directional arrows and disabled parking signs . . . “Chop-chop, Anna!” The professor’s buzz, “No time for sight-seeing!” She was right. Our gear was rated for no more than two hours. So—deeper then, through the Piazzale Roma, moving swiftly, our back-mounted propulsive units whirring as we followed a former canal . . . but everything was canal now. Over streets scraped with a thin light. Buildings coralline, calcareous, spongiform, façades pouting and delicate as the faces of children. Living-glass palazzi; an old rope-works, once preserved for the tourists; a church, its Franciscan austerity made extravagant by dully glittering icosahedra. Submerged, the city had achieved a poetic state to which it had formerly only aspired. Here it was. More than half alive, such of its masonry as remained held in place by huge, engineered radiolaria, single-celled animals distinguished by their intricate silicate skeletons, in which the creature itself was an afterthought, an excrescence pendent on symmetries of crystal. In their original form, radiolaria had been collected by Victorian miniaturists, arranging them in mosaics—the kitsch typical of the times, differing from the shell-art of seaside giftshops only by virtue of their size. But some felt that radiolarians were themselves art. To the zoologist Ernst Haeckel, they’d represented an embodiment of a hidden aspect of the evolutionary process, indistinguishable from the artistic urge. We crossed the Calle Fiubera, a place of lights and flares: construction underway; workers in heavy suits; gaunt waldos angled and clawed in answer to the arthropods that had once populated the sea floor. ‘Incipients’, as they were called, bobbed about the site at neutral buoyancy, plankton in the Venetian Gothic register: nascent villas of palladian crystal, tentacular snowflakes, larvae with organic balconies twisted like the mouths of stroke patients. A woman in a yellow hardsuit approached as we drew near, her hands raised. Absurdly, her helmet was topped with a flashing light like those on emergency vehicles. She was all claws, all sensors, a halfdaughter to the crustacean machines around us. She snapped questions, which Ines fielded clumsily, her usually smooth manipulative techniques blunted by her mask and helmet: “No, no, we’re not part of the crew here . . . We don’t have design security clearance because we aren’t on the design team . . . We’re investigating the music, looking for the source. The music; you must have heard about it.” Poor Ines. A lady of a certain type: almost elderly, breastless, thin by grim effort of will (no judgement here: I’m a big sloppy haystack of a woman). Perhaps there’d been lovers in her past, but now she was forever single; her passion was reserved for the composers, an aseptic eroticism manifesting in knowing precisely where the Easter Oratorio was situated in the Bach Catalogue, and when Beethoven’s heroic period had begun and ended. There was some to-and-fro with an Elwert+Ippolito official on the surface, after which the security woman understood our purpose. When she allowed us to move on, her voice took on a now-I’ve-seen-everything tone. But then, these days, everyone’s seen everything. Twenty minutes gone. We accelerated, sailing over a bridge, also under construction—booms and shivers; sounds felt in the belly—then above the rooftops of the Merceria Orologio. And the city opened out—it opened out—and here was the Piazza San Marco. It was alive with the hyperbolic geometries of the aquatic grotesque. Albino nudibranchs, proud of their bouncy egg-coils, flounced above a foundered shipping container, its contents unidentifiable beneath anemones and sea cucumbers. Our lights were caught by the trailing gonads of giant medusae. Colonies and fluthers, gelatinous glimmerers, spittle and living silk . . . The sovereign jellyfish, dominant life form in the newly acidic oceans of the human age. Once an early utopian visionary named Charles Fourier had predicted the world would end when the seas turned to lemonade. Now, in the Anthropocene, the marine pH was approaching that of citric acid, and methane outgassing was producing a merry effervescence in the polar seas. It didn’t feel like the end of the world to me even so. I steered between the jellies, their bells giving way to clearer water. We passed over the Basilica; an intervening palazzo. And then—a sense of elation—there it was: the dell’Ospedale della Pietà. I slowed, sight-seeing after all. * * *   ‘A fish is the movement of water embodied, given shape’—an observation from the novelist Doris Lessing—but remember that the fish is alive; it moves the water in ways that inform its own embodiment. So, in Renaissance Venice, music and architecture had each shaped the other. Composers had written their music with the intention of it being performed in certain buildings, and certain buildings had been designed to accommodate the music of favoured composers. This building—where Vivaldi spent twenty years of his life, where he’d taught violin to the orphans, where he’d written some of his greatest works—was also his musical instrument. Elwert+Ippolito warnings showed in our faceplates as we approached. We hardly needed them. The structure was clearly unsound. Only a small amount of preparatory work had been done. It was what submarine engineers called a moosh, a bricky mealiness retaining its form by accident of rot. We settled to the seabed and began setting up our recording devices at a safe distance—the first of many such installations; our long-term goal was to distribute them through the city, but the ospedale was the obvious place to start. Ines was silent as we worked. After ten minutes, I looked up to see her gazing at the ospedale. “What’s the matter?” I said. “I heard something,” she said. * * *   I don’t blame her for what happened next. Some thoughts enjoy a certain autonomy. Set down in childhood, sometimes later, they’re worn smooth as riverstones—reason streams over them almost unheeded, leaving no mark save to smooth them a little more. We shouldn’t be held responsible for them or what they make us do. I watched, helpless, as she unhooked from the clewline and kicked away. Her propulsive unit whirred. I shouted, far too late. I thought to trigger my EPIRB—a warning beacon—then gave chase. Into the demarcated zone, warnings flashing; Ines wobbling in her course, then heading upwards, for the dome. I can’t remember what I called to her. Something angry. “I heard him,” she called in reply, speaking half to herself. “He’s in—” then her signal faded as she entered through a fissure in the roof. At last I understood why she’d quoted that passage from our proposal. Her belief wasn’t too weak but too strong. Too literal. I followed her: here the dome, here the rooftop, the lead sheets exposing a porous grey matter for which there is no name, nor should there be . . . and in, through a gap—the building around me in full sulk, ceiling frescoes in blue heroic sags. I found Ines’ spotlights fifteen metres below. “What are you doing?” “Listen,” she said. “Ines, they’ve been recording the ‘anomalous sounds’ for a year without locating the source. It’s ridiculous to think we—” “Just listen!” —then I heard. Very faint, but unmistakable. It faltered, stopped, began again. At once, Ines’ engine restarted. She left the chapel, into a hall that answered onto the conservatory. Down then, after her, over ancient pews, the hallway, my lights pushing yellow cones through an excremental haze—the passage broadening, narrowing, describing an ‘S’; I was lost in the plumbing of her madness. Even so—even so—the music grew. No whale vocalisation, no crustal settling or icebergs grounding on the seabed. This was music, his music. It wasn’t one of the five-hundred works he’d composed in his lifetime, but it was his, nevertheless. And then I rounded a corner, and there was the entrance to Vivaldi’s conservatory, Ines hanging before it, lit red. The light came from an electric furnace. It powered a steam engine at the heart of a radiolarian, spindle-shaped, huge—the largest I’ve ever seen, far too large to support its own life processes. Its steam-assisted metabolic pathways chugged to the concerto being played by the man at the centre of it all. The Red Priest. Antonio Lucio Vivaldi (1678–1741). It was he. Immediately recognisable from his portraits and contemporary accounts. He saw us, and paused in his playing in order to favour me with a wink, and Ines with a saucy smile. Then back to the music, plucking the radiolarian’s plangent heartstrings, the great animal shivering—a clockglass membrane glittering open. A vacuole, an airlock. Ines accepted the invitation; the outer membrane closed behind her, the inner one opened. She removed her helmet with middle-class grace. Vivaldi gave a bow, still playing; she twinkled like a young woman, I saw this clearly; he smiled apologetically—soon, the smile said, he would be able to pay her the attention she deserved. While he played, she turned and found me, and gave a little wave as the concerto, taking flight, caused the radiolarian to do the same; shaking free of its moorings, rising on wings of song. I waved back happily as the roof parted and the living artwork rose—sign of this new age, the world that follows after nature is overcome, replaced by a new set of rules—a Freudian system, perhaps, or something else: the logic of art; why not?—thrilling but opaque, as impenetrable as we are to ourselves. It was leaving now, ascending into the lemonade sea, trailing bright music while I hung there, still in the conservatory, attending to the concerto—allegro vivaca caotico—which belonged to the cycle of concerti called in English the Four Seasons—it belonged to that cycle, but it was new too. The Fifth Season: the music of the endless, changeless, ever-changing season of the post-Anthropocene.

Overall, the transfer of risk from the banking sector to nonbanking sectors, including the household sector, appears to have enhanced the resiliency and stability of the financial system—mainly by widely dispersing financial risks, including throughout the household sector. In case of widespread failure of the household sector to manage complex investment risks, or if households suffer severe losses across the board due to sustained market downturns, there could be a political backlash demanding government support as an “insurer of last resort.” There could also be a demand for the re-regulation of the financial industry.

They were grateful for anything, and this too showed in their faces, and this too had to be ignored, as it was just another facet of their desperation. People didn’t like to feel grateful, because they didn’t like the need to feel grateful. So it was not a good feeling no matter which end of it you were on. One did good for others not for the others’ sake, nor for oneself, which would be a little sanctimonious, at best. This seemed to suggest that there was no reason at all to do good, and yet it did feel like an imperative. She did it for some kind of abstract notion, perhaps, an idea that this was part of making their time the early days of a better world.

Then comes September and the sun tilts to the south. Yes, autumn in New York: the great song of the city and the great season. Not just for the relief from the brutal extremes of winter or summer, but for that glorious slant of the light, that feeling that in certain moments lances in on that tilt—that you had been thinking you were living in a room and suddenly with a view between buildings out to the rivers, a dappled sky overhead, you are struck by the fact that you live on the side of a planet—that the great city is also a great bay on a great world. In those golden moments even the most hard-bitten citizen, the most oblivious urban creature, perhaps only pausing for a WALK sign to turn green, will be pierced by that light and take a deep breath and see the place as if for the first time, and feel, briefly but deeply, what it means to live in a place so strange and gorgeous.

“Think about ordinary people in their own lives. They need stability. They want what you could call illiquid assets, meaning home, job, health. Those aren’t liquid, and you don’t want them liquid. So you pay a steady stream of payments for those things to stay illiquid, meaning mortgage payments, health insurance, pension fund inputs, utility bills, all that sort of thing. Everyone pays every month, and finance counts on having those steady inputs of money. They borrow based on that certainty, they use that certainty as collateral, and then they use that borrowed money to bet on markets. They leverage out a hundred times their assets in hand, which mostly consist of the payment streams that people make to them. Those people’s debts are their assets, pure and simple. People have illiquidity, and finance has liquidity, and finance profits from the spread between those two states. And every spread is a chance to make more.”

In this situation, what one can say, as Giambattista Vico seems to have been one of the first to do, is that while nature is meaningless, history has a meaning; even if there is no meaning, the project and the future produce it, on the individual as well as the collective basis. The great collective project has a meaning and it is that of utopia. But the problem of utopia, of collective meaning, is to find an individual meaning. —Fredric Jameson, An American Utopia

So but what did that mean? Sixteen years older, holy shit. When I myself was sixty, and hopefully still thoroughly hale and hearty even at that admittedly elderly age, she would be seventy-six years old, ack. An inhuman number. If I got to a lucky seventy, she would be eighty-six and deeply, deeply ancient. Up and down the years, the discrepancy was like a Grand Canyon between us. But now was now. And by the time we got to that future point, I figured either she would have seen through me and broken up with me, or I would have caught a cancer and died, or more likely she would die and leave me bereft and seeking consolation with some thirty-year-old. I would be like one of those horrible Margaret Mead–Robert Heinlein line marriages and first marry someone way too old for me, then someone way too young. It sounded awful, but what was I going to do? Some people get lucky and partner up with someone the same age, they know the same songs, have the same references and all that, good for them! But for the rest of us it’s catch-as-catch-can. And just thinking of her kicking ass in the nation’s dismal swamp was making me laugh. It was going to be funny.

The point social ecology emphasizes is not that moral and spiritual persuasion and renewal are meaningless or unnecessary; they are necessary and can be educational. But modern capitalism is structurally amoral and hence impervious to moral appeals. The modern marketplace is driven by imperatives of its own, irrespective of what kind of CEO sits in a corporation's driver's seat or holds on to its handlebars.

To be fair, it’s a coherent approach. Their view is that climate progress is most likely to happen if it’s simple and narrow in scope—focused mainly on energy, minimally intrusive in everyday life, and garnering agreement among policy elites. For these skeptics, it’s precisely because inequalities are so entrenched that it would be reckless to hinge decarbonization on struggles for universal, quality social services and public control over markets. Getting to net zero carbon in the United States in ten years—or even twenty—will be hard enough. Why add the extra burdens of dismantling inequalities and disciplining capital?

growth or degrowth. GDP growth has never been a great metric for the things we care about. The past forty years show that it can continue without benefiting most people’s well-being or trickling down. Contrary to the ideology of capitalism, materially intensive growth can’t continue forever. We can’t pretend ecological limits don’t exist. And contrary to the arguments of clean technophiles, there’s zero evidence that growth can be meaningfully “decoupled” from resource use, or occur without environmental impact. Our view is that we need a “Last Stimulus” of green economic development in the short term to build landscapes of public affluence, develop new political-economic models, jump off the growth treadmill, break with capital, and settle into a slower groove.

'Man's empire over the inferior creatures of God' was thus substituted for the' earth family'. This conceptual diminution was essential to the project of colonization and capitalism. The concept of an earth family excluded the possibilities of exploitation and domination, therefore a denial of the rights of nature and nature-based societies was essential in order to facilitate an uncontrolled right to exploitation and profits.

While science itself is a product of social forces and has a social agenda determined by those who can mobilize scientific production, in contemporary times scientific activity has been assigned a privileged epistemological position of being socially and politically neutral. Thus science takes on a dual character: it offers technological fixes for social and political problems, but absolves and distances itself from the new social and political problems it creates. Reflecting the priorities and perceptions of particular class, gender, or cultural interests, scientific thought organizes and transforms the natural and social order. However, since both nature and society have their own organization, the superimposition of a new order does not necessarily take place in a faultless and orderly fashion. There is often resistance from people and nature, a resistance which is externalized as 'unanticipated side effects'.

California continues to subsidize this fossil extraction. It hands over land through lease approvals and other forms of state aid. And its enhanced oil recovery tax credit allows oil producers to write off drilling costs, in addition to federal tax breaks; in 2018, Chevron paid a negative 4 percent federal tax rate, receiving $181 million in rebates.

This populist analysis blames opulence, money, and abstract exchange while ignoring the equally problematic nature of good old fashioned exploitative wage labor, or how the two are mutually intertwined. Furthermore, both lines of argument must also cope with a present reality wherein to even be exploited as waged labor is increasingly the luxurious privilege of a dwindling few.

The exquisitely designed pottery of a vanishing artisan world, the beautifully crafted furnishings, the colorful and subtly intricate patterns of textiles, the carefully wrought ornaments, the beautifully sculpted tools and weapons-all attest to a wealth of skills, to a care for product, to a desire for self-expression, and to a creative concern for detail and uniqueness that has faded almost completely from the productive activity of our day. Our admiration for these artisan works unconsciously extends into a sense of inferiority or loss of the artisan world in which they were formed-a world that is all the more impressive because we recognize the high degree of subjectivity expressed by the objects. We feel that identifiable human beings imprinted their personalities on these goods; that they possessed a highly attuned sensitivity to the materials they handled, the tools they used, and to the age-old artistic norms their culture established over countless generations. Ultimately, what arouses us emotionally is the fact that these objects attest to a fecund human spirit, a creative subjectivity that articulated its cultural heritage and its wealth in materials that might otherwise seem pedestrian and beyond artistic merit in our own society.

Better and safer to deal with technics as tools, machines, labor, and design than as coercive political institutions that organize the very implements, work, and imagination involved in the modern technical ensemble. Better to deal with how these means achieve certain destructive or constructive forms on the natural landscape than to explore the deformations they produce within subjectivity itself.

To speak of "appropriate technologies," "convivial tools," and "voluntary simplicity" without radically challenging the political "technologies," the media "tools," and the bureaucratic "complexities" that have turned these concepts into elitist "art forms" is to completely betray their revolutionary promise as a challenge to the existing social structure.

The most important feature of technics in a preindustrial societal complex is the extent to which it ordinarily is adaptive rather than innovative. Where a culture is rich in social structure, where it enjoys a wealth of human relationships, communal responsibilities, and a shared body of mutual concerns, it tends to elaborate a new technical ensemble rather than "develop" it. Controlled by the constraints of usufruct, complementarity, the irreducible minimum, and dis accumulation, early societies tended to elaborate technics with considerable prudence and with a keen sensitivity for the extent to which it could be integrated into existing social institutions

The ancient world under the domination of Rome had in fact reached a kind of climax in the technological field. By the end of the Roman period many technologies had advanced as far as possible with the equipment then available, and for further progress to be made, a bigger or more complex plant was required. Despite the fact that the Romans were quite capable of indulging in gigantic undertakings, their technologies remained at the smallequipment level. Thus, for example, if it was required to increase the output of iron the number of furnaces was multiplied, but the furnaces themselves remained the same size. Whatever the cause, the idea of building a larger furnace and devising machinery to work it seems to have been beyond the

Given sufficient exposure to external forces, a process of negative selection on the level of political life has always been at work to favor the expansion of ruthless cultures at the expense of the more equable ones. What is surprising about social development is not the emergence of New and Old World despotisms, but their absence in large areas of the world generally. It is testimony to the benign power inherent in organic society that so many cultures did not follow the social route to Statehood, mobilized labor, class distinctions, and professional warfare-indeed, that they often retreated into remoter areas to spare themselves this destiny.

Finally, no religion assailed more earnestly the authenticity, intensity, and meaningfulness of community affiliation than Christianity. The Stoic plea for a recognition of a universal humanitas entailed not a denial of one's loyalty to the community but merely the individual's recognition of mystical affinity to the "city of Man." The Christian plea for a universal humanitas was actually more cunning. It shrewdly acknowledged the claims of the State but tried to replace the community's claims with those of the "city of God," notably the Church.

In equating "living well" with living affluently, capitalism has made it extremely difficult to demonstrate that freedom is more closely identified with personal autonomy than with affluence, with empowerment over life than with empowerment over things, with the emotional security that derives from a nourishing community life than with a material security that derives from the myth of a nature dominated by an all-mastering technology.

Certainly, no ethical argument in itself will ever persuade the denied and underprivileged that they must abdicate any claim to the relative affluence of capitalism. What must be demonstrated-and not merely on theoretical or statistical grounds alone-is that this affluence can ultimately be made available to all-but should be desirable to none. It is a betrayal of the entire message of social ecology to ask the world's poor to deny themselves access to the necessities of life on grounds that involve long-range problems of ecological dislocation, the shortcomings of "high" technology, and very specious claims of natural shortages in materials, while saying nothing at all about the artificial scarcity engineered by corporate capitalism. Anything that is not renewable is exhaustible-this is a philistine truism. But confronted by such truisms, one may reasonably ask: When will it be exhausted? How? By whom? And for what reason? For the present there can be no serious claim that any major, irreplaceable resource will be exhausted until humanity can choose new alternatives "new" referring not simply to material or technical alternatives but above all to institutional and social ones. The task of advancing humanity's right to choose from among alternatives, particularly institutional ones, that may yet offer us a rational, humanistic, and ecological trajectory has not yet been fulfilled by "high" or by "low"

In sum, "high" technology must be used by serious social ecologists to demonstrate that, on rational grounds, it is less desirable than ecological technologies. "High" technology must be permitted to exhaust its specious claims as the token of social "progress" and human well-being-all the more to render the development of ecological alternatives a matter of choice rather than the product of a cynical "necessity."

"freedom" is still conceived as freedom from labor, not freedom for work. Here we encounter the aimless interests of the isolated ego, the rootless "libertarian" monad who wanders waywardly through life as the counterpart of the wayward, rootless bourgeois monad. The workers in A Nous la Liberte, Rene Clair's playful French "utopia" of the early 1930s, achieve their freedom in a highly industrialized land of Cokaygne: their functions are taken over completely by machines while they do nothing but frolic in nearby fields and fish en masse along river banks that have an uncanny resemblence to their assembly lines. This is characteristically very moderne. Clair's hoboes, the principal characters of the motion picture, leave the tramp's version of freedom imprinted on the conclusion of the cinematic "utopia." They are the "masterless men" of the twentieth century who have yet to be formed into citizens of a community, like the rootless, wandering radicals of the New Left who carried their "community" in their knapsacks or under the roofs of their trucks. The "utopia" is charming but aimless, spontaneous but unformed, easy-going but structureless, poetic but irresponsible. One may live long in such a "utopia" but not "live well."

Freedom existed for activity, not from activity. It was not a realm but a practice- the practice of being free by participating in free institutions, by daily recreating, elaborating, and fostering the activity of being free. One was not merely "free" in the passive sense of freedom from constraint, but in the active sense of "freeing," both of oneself and one's fellow citizens. An authentic community is not merely a structural constellation of human beings but rather the practice of communizing.

Hence, an ecologically oriented technical imagination must seek to discover the "Way" of things as ensembles, to sense the subjectivity of what we so icily call "natural resources," to respect the attunement that should exist between the human community and the ecosystem in which it is rooted. This imagination must seek not merely a means for resolving the contradictions between town and country, a machine and its materials, or the functional utility of a device and its impact on its natural environment. It must try to achieve their artistic, richly colored, and highly articulated integration. Labor, perhaps even more than technics, must recover its own creative voice. Its abstract form, its deployment in the framework of linear time as a res temporalis, its cruel objectification as mere, homogeneous energy, must yield to the concreteness of skill, to the festiveness of communal activity, to a recognition of its own subjectivity. In this broad revitalization of the natural environment, of work, and of technics, it would be impossible for the technical imagination to confine itself to the traditional imagery of a lifeless, irreducible, and passive material substrate. We must close the disjunction between an orderly world that lends itself to rational interpretation and the subjectivity that is needed to give it meaning.

Lynn White, Jr., in fact, roots the Western coercive attitude towards nature as far back as Carolingian times, with the ascendancy of the heavy European plough and the consequent tendency to allot land to peasants not according to their family subsistence needs but "in proportion to their contribution to the ploughteam.

Radical agriculture seeks to restore humanity's sense of community: first, by giving full recognition to the soil as an ecosystem, a biotic community; and second, by viewing agriculture as the activity of a natural human community, a rural society and culture.

Radical agriculture offers a meaningful response to this desperate situation in terms not of a fanciful fight to a remote agrarian refuge, but of a systematic recolonlization of the land along ecological lines. Cities are to he decentralised—and this is no longer a utopistic fantasy but a visible necessity which even conventional city planning is beginning to recognize—and new ecocommunities are to be established, tailored artistically to the ecosystems in which they are located. These ecocommunities are to be scaled to human dimensions, both to afford the greatest degree of self-management possible and personal comprehension of the social situation. No bureaucratic manipulative, centralized administration here, but a voluntaristic system in which the economy, society and ecology of an area are administered by the community as a whole, and the distribution of the means of life is determined by need, rather than by labour, profit or accumulation.

For side by side with the massive, highly specialized fossil-fuel technology in use today, we are beginning to see the emergence of a new technology—one that lends itself to the local deployment of many energy resources on a small scale (wind, solar and geothermal)—that provides a wider latitude in the use of small, multipurpose machinery, and that can easily provide us with the high-quality semifinished goods that we, as individuals, may choose to finish according to our proclivities and tastes.

Not only does an excessive division of labor make for overorganization in the form of huge bureaucracies and tremen-dous expenditures of resources in transporting materials over great distances; it reduces the possibilities of eff ectively recycling wastes, avoiding pollution that may have its source in highly concentrated industrial and population centers, and making sound use of local or regional raw materials.

Yet still others in the ecology movement too often end up advocating a kind of “cooperative” capitalism, in which one community functions like a single entrepreneur, with a sense of proprietorship toward its resources. Such a system of cooperatives once again marks the beginnings of a market system of distribution, as cooperatives become entangled in the web of “bourgeois rights,” that is, in contracts and bookkeeping that focus on the exact amounts a community will receive in “exchange” for what it delivers to others.

A confederalist view involves a clear distinction between policymaking and the coordination and execution of adopted policies. Policymaking is exclusively the right of popular community assemblies based on the practices of participatory democracy. Administration and coordination are the responsibility of confederal councils, which become the means for interlinking villages, towns, neighborhoods, and cities into confederal networks. Power thus fl ows from the bottom up instead of from the top down, and in confederations, the fl ow of power from the bottom up diminishes with the scope of the federal council ranging territorially from localities to regions and from regions to ever-broader territorial areas.

The trade policy of a radical Green New Deal could end the race to the bottom logic of global capitalism. Instead, we would race to the top for labor and environmental standards, including “ratcheting mechanisms” to improve standards over time. We would also reverse the logic of trade negotiations: progressive state officials would negotiate so that labor, human rights, and environmental clauses are agreed upon before anything else is addressed, instead of being tacked on as an afterthought (if at all). Deals would require free, prior, and informed consent on the part of Indigenous communities located at the sites of extraction.

Marxism’s economic insights belonged to an era of emerging factory capitalism in the nineteenth century. Brilliant as a theory of the material preconditions for socialism, it did not address the ecological, civic, and subjective forces or the effi cient causes that could impel humanity into a movement for revolutionary social change. On the contrary, for nearly a century, Marxism stagnated theoretically. Its theorists were often puzzled by developments that had passed it by and, since the 1960s, have mechanically appended environmentalist and fem-inist ideas to its formulaic ouvrierist outlook.

As a result, the Marxists unavoidably saw the political realm, which it designated a workers’ state, as a repressive entity, ostensibly based on the interests of a single class: the proletariat.

Social ecology is an ecology not of hunger and material deprivation but of plenty; it seeks the creation of a rational society in which waste, indeed excess, will be controlled by a new system of values; and when or if shortages arise as a result of irrational behavior, popular assemblies will establish rational standards of consumption by democratic processes.

we think fighting for a new world starts with imagining it viscerally. People mobilize around concrete projects that appeal to their desires and values. The climate fight will be a long one—but its projects need to bear fruit soon if they’re to rouse the people fighting for change and energize them to keep pushing for more. Within a virtuous cycle of mobilization, each victory opens up new vistas of bigger dreams and bolder demands—and even campaigns that don’t achieve all their goals can build power and raise expectations. The strategic corollary is that clear goals require clear opponents. As we’ve argued, “we” are not all responsible for the climate crisis in the same way—and we are not “all in it together.” The broader our popular coalitions and the more contemptible our enemies—fossil fuel executives, craven politicians, private utilities, the landlord class—the stronger our movements.

Consumers don’t drive this process. This doesn’t mean consumption is irrelevant: in a strictly technical sense, our needs create all economic activity. But production determines what shape consumption takes and creates new needs. Figure One is a snapshot of that process. In the middle row, money is separated out into Speculative capital (Ms) and bank capital (Mbc), which provide the initial investment to create commodities (C) in the production process (P). Through the purchase of the Means of Production (MP) and the exploitation of Labor Power (LP), surplus value is created, appropriated and made into more commodities (C‘) and money (M‘). Commodities are sold in different spheres, M‘ gets fed back into production and the loop continues. It rarely works as it’s supposed to: speculation, raw materials shortages and strikes can interrupt profit–making.

In the Global South, billions of people live on less than $2 a day. In this context, calling for people to consume less misses the point. Real ethical consumption is collective. Capitalism makes it impossible for most people to meet their needs on their own, but as a society, we could provide houses, hospitals and schools for all. The only reason shoddy merchandise gets made is because capital creates a market for the people it underpays. Redistribute wealth and consumption could skyrocket, as everything from public transportation to musical instruments got used communally, while poor quality, useless items wouldn’t find any demand. Obviously this implies a vast change in the structure of ownership and consumption, but it’s a far more positive vision than localism’s individualism.

Money represents what Ingham calls a “promise to pay”: to use it, everyone has to believe that his or her debts will be repaid. In that sense, economies are based on trust. But this isn’t the same trust that localists invoke, as when Estill writes, “trade is a function of trust, and it is trusting one another that lies at the heart of our local economy.” Rather, capital must trust states to enforce the right to accumulate, backed up by violence when necessary. A complex market needs an institution like a state to enforce general respect for property rights and one to generalize credit: a bank. Ingham points out that when Afghan warlords issue their own 63 currency, they enforce the promise to pay better than the national state. Money represents the social and political aspects of capitalist power.

Schumacher argues, “human life can continue without industry, whereas it cannot continue without agriculture.” This is a false dichotomy: capital treats agriculture as an industry and capital itself came from rural property relations.

Well before large–scale industry existed, the landowners applied industrial principles to agriculture to feed their workers, increase productivity and intensify work. This process of theft and exploitation created the capitalist economy: not only did agriculture become a separate branch of industry, the whole concept of countryside and city came into being: the rural became sparsely populated and the urban concentrated.

Large farms produce more efficient output: yet as output goes up, prices fall and farms need to become even bigger to realize a profit. Growth is self–reinforcing: the bigger the output, the more land and machinery is needed to produce it. Processing creates more value than raw material production, and agribusinesses are able to capture many points of the commodity chain that small farmers can’t.

Small farms, of course, continue to exist. Just like other small businesses, they perform useful services to capital, taking on many risks that large firms would rather avoid such as operating with smaller profit margins. Big capital doesn’t have to control everything directly: as long as small farms are indebted, big capital can set the conditions under which production takes place. Owner–occupiers are reduced to supervisors and receive a small share of any value produced.

Rent isn’t just a drain on capitalist finances. It determines what gets produced and how much capital gets invested in a particular space. It equalizes profits between agriculture and other sectors, so that capital doesn’t rush into agriculture to 81 earn super–profits and spark a crisis of overproduction. Rent centralizes capital by taking income from many small farmers. By taxing profits, rent forces producers to introduce new technologies and change the landscape: for example, factory farms concentrate production in one place to avoid the costs of renting large tracts of land.

Rent was the midwife to capitalism, helping individual capitals to centralize. Today, landed property and industrial capital are simply two different ways to generate more capital: there are no separate class 82 interests between landowners and production owners. For Marx, farmers were capitalists who produce commodities from the land rather than factories. This is even truer today.

when poor farmers produce use–values like carbon–storage, water purification and animal habitats, they generate an estimated three trillion dollars per year of services to the global ecosphere. The World Bank suggests paying for land’s environmental services. However, by attaching a price tag to those eco–services, commodifying land would actually increase differential rents. This would lead to massive estates of landowners who could speculate on the new values of their land. Government would have to raise 93 taxes to pay for these new rents.

When capital in the Global North invests in land, outputs rise and food is overproduced, meaning commodities can’t be sold profitably at home. But subsidies mean that even poor–quality lands in the North can still earn rents in the South or, as with biofuels, create entirely new commodities. With worse–quality land brought into production, higher rent becomes available, fuelling more overproduction. These high rents don’t just earn money for agribusiness: by driving out smaller, less efficient competitors, they can force open markets to capital. Combined with the neoliberal political project, dumping subsidized produce clears land for producing cash crops for the world market on a rationalized, large–scale basis, starting the cycle of overproduction again.

To sum up, capital centralizes land ownership to try to produce more and drive down costs. This creates surplus capital that, in turn, drives more centralization and creates higher rents. Agribusiness dominates food production because of its advantages in technology, economies of scale and political weight. In specific circumstances, pro–and anti–market UA can create niche markets or provide use–values. But both have to confront capitalist competition. UA must earn differential rent, since it’s located in cities where plenty of rent is available from other uses.

Subsidies distort this process further, keeping poor quality land in production. Profit–seeking UA may generate higher rents, but the benefits are temporary as capital subjects agriculture to the same pressures of mechanization like any other industry. When agribusiness uses technology to replace humans, it can drive down commodity costs to the point where UA’s lower transportation costs don’t give it any competitive edge. And since small farms are more likely to be mortgaged, any higher rents they generate will go right back to the bank. Consumers 99 can subsidize UA, but this isn’t a long–term basis for scaling up or sustaining local production.

The universal discourse of rights and freedoms was limited to a formal political process: workers weren’t free to take over the social wealth they’d created. To maintain this system, bourgeois ideology had to make its own rule seem natural and inevitable. Economic individualism, the universal competition for profit read back into human nature, suited that purpose. Capitalism isn’t the first system to steal from its producers. But what distinguishes it from earlier forms of class rule is its hidden nature. In feudalism, it was very clear who grew the crops and who took them afterwards. In capitalism, we wouldn’t exist without 106 society supporting and shaping us, but society itself looks like a loose collection of individuals. “And,” as Margaret Thatcher said, “You know, there is no such thing as society.”

There are no family networks to inherit capital through or collective communities to depend on. They face daily “ethical, aesthetic or political dilemmas” that determine their well–being and future prospects, making everyday life into a series of strategic decisions. Members of the petite bourgeoisie assume that the sum of their voluntary choices creates social change. Put together, these choices equal a lifestyle, which both legitimizes those who practice it and models that behavior for others. Its ‘lifestylism’ makes the petite bourgeoisie unique: it is the only class to demonstrate these values not through propaganda and overt control (which it will never have) or collective resistance; instead it seeks “its occupational and personal salvation in the imposition of new doctrines of ethical salvation.” Thus, Bourdieu writes, “the new petite bourgeoisie is predisposed to play a vanguard role in the struggles over everything concerned with the art of living, in particular, domestic life and consumption.”

Capital gets to be universal, demanding subsidies, expensive regeneration projects and flexible labor markets. Local communities remain responsible for social and ecological problems. These problems mean that slowly expanding local social enterprises is what Hahnel calls “a utopian pipe dream.” Decentralization becomes part of neoliberalism’s deep, structural changes, unleashing market forces that will fix all social ills. This is why governments are warming to “localism, localism, localism”: not as an alternative to neoliberalism, but as a way to implement it.

Postcapitalism started by criticizing a key premise of classical Marxism: that anti–capitalism can only happen at the point of production. If workers stop work, they stop producing surplus value and the system grinds to a halt. However, as 152 Marxist–feminists have pointed out, this ignores reproduction. Workers don’t disappear after work: they need to eat, sleep and raise the next generation of workers. This has traditionally been seen (or rather, not seen) as women’s work. The home and community are also workplaces for nannies and other ‘caring professions’: value gets created outside the formal, public realm, in private spaces. The line between production and reproduction gets blurry. The home and community, and not just the workplace, are sites for anti–capitalist struggle.

Gibson–Graham ask, “If we viewed the economic landscape as imperfectly colonized, homogenized, systematized, might we not find openings for projects of noncapitalist invention?” Of course: capital is quite happy to let workers survive without paying for it, and one of the pillars of neoliberalism is that workers need to stop blaming the system and start looking after themselves. But perhaps the unemployed and deindustrialized are right to ask capital to pay for the privilege of using and abandoning localities.

In capitalism a surplus can only mean exploitation, the appropriation of surplus value from the working class. This is precisely why neoclassical economics had to do away with surplus and create the concept of equilibrium in the first place.

localism emerged to fill the vacuum. Postmodern Marxism, the intellectual milieu that inspires SE, emerged from the decline of those social movements. Theorists rejected a structural Marxism that pushed social movements into rigid categories. Instead, the goal was to grasp local spaces concretely. But along the way, theorists stripped Marxism of its universalist qualities, rejecting, as David Camfield argues, “claims… that capital has determinate laws of motion and that social production plays a distinctively powerful role in shaping the course of the evolution of human societies… (substituting) a decentered notion of society, and the celebration of difference.”22 The local changed from a space to analyze and resist to a free space where people could make their own world.

This is the danger of 166 postcapitalism: by trying to redefine people as social actors with real power, it redefines the much greater power of capital out of existence. In doing so, it actually reproduces the determinist, structuralist accounts of capital it loathes. By refusing to fight neoliberalism, the “noncapitalist imaginary” leaves capitalist reality untouched. The most oppressed members of the working class, local communities of poor people of color, must drag themselves out of the predicament capital placed them in, by being as flexible and adaptable as possible.

it’s a mistake to see localism as inherently oppositional. In its most diverse, celebratory and pro–community forms, official and radical localisms form a continuum, adapting non–market relationships for capital accumulation. By promoting local solutions to a global system, the centers of power remain free to impose market discipline: this, paradoxically, ensures a continuing need for localism. Localism can be a strategy of neoliberalism.

Catastrophe doesn’t just free us from being dominated by laws of motion; it makes us personally responsible for world–historical tasks. Murray agrees that we can’t just assume class struggle exists. However, he warns against leaving it to our personal desires: “(w)ith so small an area submitted to the pessimism of the intellect, too large a zone is left to the optimism of the will.” That shifts quickly to pessimism of the will: an existential resignation in the face of the huge problems facing anti–capitalists, which overpowers any advantages from “fragility.”

There’s nothing inevitable about socialism or capitalism. Capitalism removed blocks to social development by force, destroying pre–capitalist industry and creating a vast social surplus. This is what Lenin meant when he said capitalism “increases the population’s need for association, for organization” along class lines. Capitalism socializes the working class, giving it the training and experience in collective work to run society itself.

As democratic social movements become larger, they also become more effective at winning reforms. But reforms by themselves aren’t enough: even militant working class movements like the ANC in South Africa and the Workers Party in Brazil made peace with capital once they got elected. Asking whether they ‘sold out’ and lost their ethical vigilance isn’t the right question, because this assumes individuals, or even political leaders, have a moral power to shape capitalism. Capital has its own priorities: it will reward political leaders who maintain the conditions for accumulation, and it will undermine or abandon those who don’t.

PB is a resolutely localist project. It promotes community values and activism and encourages democratic control over the market. But it’s also a way to reconcile tenants to neoliberal policy. The TCHC management developed it in response to cutbacks in the 1990s. As one tenant said, “When you are sitting in your own community, you don’t understand why they don’t fix things or why you can’t have the things you want.... With this budget process, people began to see how limited the funding was and the need for it out there.” Rather than organizing to resist the cutbacks, the process framed them as inevitable. This is reinforced by the paltry amount PB allocates: the $1.8 million is a small part of the annual $138 million in capital costs, let alone the $564 million operating budget, and certainly a tiny amount compared to the $300 million backlog of needed repairs.
